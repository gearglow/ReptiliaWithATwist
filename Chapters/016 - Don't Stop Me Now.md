## Chapter 16: Don't Stop Me Now

The week leading up to the race, not to put too fine a point on it, flew by. The triad spent most of their spare time helping Elysia prepare. Between the three girls and Robbie, the modifications to Elysia's Firebolt only took a few hours, as it turned out, and so the rest of the time was spent practicing in the Room of Requirement, with Hermione and Luna (and frequently Nell, Ginny, and Ron) doing their best to throw Elysia off course -- or off her broom.

They quickly found that the most troublesome situations were when something interfered with Elysia's vision -- smoke, mirrors, and so forth. This led to a slew of adjustments to Elysia's glasses, from variable-frequency vision filters to a full ley line-based navigation suite built into the HUD (all of which were immediately copied to Luna and Hermione's goggles).

"What about echolocation?" Luna asked at one point.

"Not terribly helpful when you're flying faster than the echoes can bounce back," Hermione replied, "but it might come in handy for a different task."

"Can't hurt to add it now, anyway," Elysia said, suiting action to words.

Finally, the week was over, the preparations were done, and Elysia was as ready as she could be.

### Hex Games Stadium, Hogwarts Grounds, Scotland	1994/11/12, 10:30

"Welcome, one and all, to the first event in the newly-christened Hex Games!" Ludo Bagman's voice rang out. "Our six competitors are the best and brightest from the top three schools of magic in Europe, and they're raring to go on this beautiful November morning here at our host school, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!"

The six champions were sequestered away in a tent just off the quidditch pitch, performing last-minute preparations under the watchful eye of Bartemius Crouch.

"Our event today is a five-lap, no-holds-barred broom race, on one of the most challenging courses ever devised! As the course is being assembled," Bagman continued, "allow me to direct your attention to the Judges' Booth, and the array of Projecting Pensieves just below it. Each of our champions will be given a special amulet with a monitoring charm, tying them to one of the pensieves. We'll be able to view all the action as if we were following just a broom-length or two behind! A seventh pensieve will give an overhead view of wherever the judges direct, so you won't miss a thing, folks!"

"That's your cue," Crouch announced flatly, handing out the amulets.

The crowd cheered as the air above the pensieves flickered to life.

"And there's the signal! Please welcome our champions!"

_Hit it, bro!_ Elysia sent.

As the six followed Crouch out to the starting line, they couldn't help but saunter to the beat of Judas Priest's _Living After Midnight._ Robbie faded the music out as they all took their places at the starting line. 

Elysia took the opportunity to transfigure her glasses into goggles, trimmed in gunmetal to match her Ironbelly jacket and boots. She'd popped out one day to pick up some leather trousers and gloves from a muggle motorcycle shop and charmed them to match, and now she zipped her jacket over a Motörhead tee and grinned up at the stands, where Luna and Hermione blew her kisses.

A black curtain hung before them, hiding the course for the moment. Elysia surreptitiously and wandlessly cast _phản xạ hoàn hảo,_ a Vietnamese spell for perfect reflexes. Her pupils dilated, her ears twitched, and a rush of static electricity swept across her skin.

"Champions, mount your brooms!" Bagman boomed. "Three, two, one, GO!"

The curtain fell. As Robbie took over the airwaves with Motörhead's _Ace of Spades,_ Elysia dropped a muttered (and unheard) "_kettenblitzschlag!_" behind her, triggered the modified windscreen bubble, and shot forward with an ear-splitting roar as the sound barrier shattered in her wake.

The spell she'd cast, an ancient German chain-lightning stunner, caught all five of the other champions. It didn't knock them unconscious, but it did lock their muscles for several crucial seconds -- plenty of time for Elysia to gain an early and dominating lead.

The curtain had hidden a tunnel of mirrors, twisting and looping all over Hogwarts' grounds, and Elysia's Perfect Reflexes spell was put to the test immediately. She tapped her goggles to adjust them to a spectrum the mirrors didn't reflect perfectly (a combination of radio and upper ultraviolet, which the goggles beamed out ahead of her into the dim tunnel of mirrors) and immediately had to veer left with a modified Split-S turn.

"Was that _lightning magic?_" An incredulous Bagman shouted over the music as the other champions began to shake off the stunner and get underway. "Yes indeed! Our youngest champion with an impossibly strong start, opening with the sort of magic long believed to be only the stuff of legend, and following that up with the fastest start any of the judges have ever seen! I have with me Mikhail Engel, of Ellerby & Spudmore, makers of the Firebolt broom, who have graciously gifted several of our champions with Firebolts to help even the playing field. Mikhail, what _was_ that?"

"Well, Ludo," Engel said, a faint German accent tinting his words, "like most of the other champions, excepting Miss Delacour and her signature customized Volière _Coup de Soleil,_ the young Miss Potter is definitely riding a Firebolt -- her own, first-run, serial number of 86 -- which should have a theoretical top speed of 250 miles per hour under ideal circumstances, such as a Suicide Dive. What we just witnessed was Potter breaking the sound barrier from a cold start, flying horizontally -- unless I miss my guess, going well over a thousand miler per hour!"

Bagman gaped like a fish as a collective gasp rose from the crowd. "But -- _how!?_"

Engel shrugged eloquently. "If I knew, we'd be selling it. At a guess, she stripped out the limiter spells, but without compensating for the resulting acceleration forces, she should have passed out almost immediately from blood-flow problems."

Just then, Elysia blew past them.

"And that's the first lap!" Bagman crowed. "Elysia Potter, with a time of just over 30 seconds! For reference, folks, this course was paced out with a Cleansweep 9 at 10 minutes per lap."

On the pensieves, the other champions were fighting a fierce neck-and-neck battle partway down the track until Elysia lapped them. The sonic boom knocked them about like toy boats in a bathtub when the dog jumps in, and the others found out the hard way that the mirrors had been charmed unbreakable -- and bouncy.

They'd barely gotten themselves sorted out and made it a scant few hundred meters down the track before she did it again.

"Right, that's it!" Cedric said. He waved his wand and conjured a net across the full span of the tunnel behind him.

They'd made it just far enough past that Cedric thought his net had actually worked, when Elysia blew past them yet again as if the net had never existed. Cedric chanced a look back -- his net was still intact!

As he watched, though, the net disintegrated into dust, wafting away on the breeze. He tore his gaze away just in time to avoid ramming headlong into the side of the tunnel.

And then she blew past him again, and all he could do was growl.

Back at the finish line, Elysia crossed for the fifth time, finishing her final lap with a Hammerhead Stall. She back-flipped off her broom at the apex, casting βροντή (_vrontí_), the Greek Thunder-Step charm, and free-fell into a Hero Landing with her broom swept back behind her like a sword as the ground cratered beneath her.

As she stood, the last strains of _Ace of Spades_ faded out to the absolutely deafening applause from the crowd.

"That might be the hottest thing I've ever seen," Luna gasped to Hermione, who agreed vehemently before dragging her down to meet their girlfriend on the sidelines with a crushing hug and many passionate kisses.

> To Do:

> - [x] Crush the broom race in the First Task

-----



Madame Pomfrey insisted on giving Elysia a quick check-over, despite her complaints, but could find nothing wrong.

Elysia just shrugged, tapping her goggles with her wand to revert them to glasses.

Madame Pomfrey harrumphed and gave Elysia a mug of pickle juice. "Be sure to drink that all down, now, until it stops tasting good," she instructed. "All that wind in your face dries you out. You need to replenish your electrolytes."

"Cheers," Elysia said, toasting Madame Pomfrey and chugging the entire mug in one go. Her hands shook as the adrenaline wore off.

They made it up to the stands while the rest of the champions were in the midst of their second lap. Robbie was there with a crate full of butterbeer and a tub of popcorn, accompanied by Sirius (in disguise, of course, with wavy brown hair to his shoulder blades, pulled back into a ponytail, and warm brown eyes that sparkled with laughter instead of his usual steel-grey), the Weasleys, and Nell. The three girls snuggled up together to watch the rest of the race.

"You're still on camera, Ellie," Hermione mentioned, grinning.

"Lucky them," Elysia smirked, planting another kiss on Hermione's lips.

"Ooh, nice Immelmann from Izzy!" Luna gushed.

For Izzy had narrowly dodged a hex from Krum as they rounded a vertical hairpin turn. Anna took the chance to pull ahead, neck and neck with Fleur. Cedric lagged behind a bit; it seemed that he'd yet to recover from his net gambit.

"Looks like quite the battle," Elysia said smugly. "Guess I got my wish after all."

"And what wish is that?" Luna asked, eyes twinkling.

"To watch the games from the stands, cuddled up with you two," Elysia replied, giving both girls a squeeze.



-----



Finally, after another twenty minutes or so, Krum and Diggory crossed the finish line of their final lap, bringing the First Task to a close. Bagman gestured for Elysia to join the others for the final scoring.

Elysia kissed her girlfriends, grabbed her broom, and vaulted over the edge of the stands, hanging from her Firebolt by one hand as she drifted quickly down in a corona of illusory lightning, blowing kisses toward the stands the whole way. The crowd went wild.

"Sweet Circe," Izzy muttered. "Who even _is_ this girl?"

"Whoever entered her didn't know what zey were in for," Fleur agreed.

"And now, the times!" Bagman crowed. "In last place, with a time of 25:43, Viktor Krum!"

"It voss a lucky shot, Kozlov," Krum grumbled.

Anna sniffed disdainfully. "Luck had nothing to do with it."

"In fifth place," Bagman continued, "with a time of 25:42, Cedric Diggory!"

"That net cost you, huh?" Elysia said.

Cedric grinned sheepishly. "Didn't expect you to blow through it like it wasn't even there!"

"Disruptor. Remind me to show you later."

Cedric nodded as Bagman went on.

"In fourth, with a time of 24:16, Anna Kozlov!"

Krum shot her another glare. Elysia stifled a cackle.

"In third, with a time of 22:42, Izabella Maradona!"

Izzy bounced on her heels, waving at the crowd.

"In second, with a time of 21:12, Fleur "Flurry Rush" Delacour!"

Fleur waved as if she were in a pageant.

"'Flurry Rush'?" Elysia asked.

"I _do_ race professionally, you know," Fleur retorted.

"And today's winner, with a frankly unbelievable time of 02:33, our youngest champion, the Green-Eyed Lightning, the Girl-Who-Lived herself, Elysia Potter!"

Elysia bowed with a flourish to thunderous applause.

"That concludes the First Task of the first-ever Hex Games! We'll see you right back here in two weeks for a spectacle of daring, nerve, and prowess like you've never seen before: the Second Task!"

As the professors began tearing down the course, Bagman called the champions up to the judges' booth for an informal Q&A with Rita Skeeter. The other judges had already left.

"We were going to do this in the Great Hall," he said, "but it's so nice out today!"

"It is, at that," Elysia agreed, settling back in a conjured loveseat between her girlfriends, who'd followed her, and cracking open a butterbeer. Her broom disappeared back into her left-hand mage-space holster. "Cast away, Rita."

The others emulated Elysia, conjuring comfortable chairs and settling back with their own drinks.

"I think we all want to know, Ellie," Rita began. "_How?_"

Elysia grinned as Luna and Hermione giggled. "Ellerby & Spudmore make a good broom," she understated. "I just took the limiter off and took a few steps to mitigate the maneuvering stresses -- the muggles call those 'G-forces', G for gravitational. For instance," she misdirected, "trousers charmed to tighten during intense maneuvering to keep the blood in the brain instead of pooling in the legs. It's a muggle fighter pilot trick, actually."

"Muggles can fly that fast?" Rita asked incredulously.

"Faster," Elysia said. "Supersonic flight's been routine for them since the 1950s or so. They have an airplane they call the Blackbird, which can fly at over Mach 3 -- Mach being a measure of the speed of sound. So Mach 3 means three times the speed of sound. They landed people on the moon, too, back in 1969, and to do that they had to go over 20,000 miles per hour."

The wizard-raised among them gaped.

"In comparison," Elysia continued, "stripping the limiter lets the Firebolt top out at roughly Mach 1.8 -- 1,300 MPH or so. And it handles like a dream even at speed, by the way," she added, shooting a look at Engel. "I'd say it hits top speed in a straightaway at maybe 6 seconds? Figure out the G-force problem and nothing can touch it. Otherwise the rider's likely going to black out and crash almost immediately. It's like being kicked in the chest by a giant."

"Try being caught in your wake," Cedric grumbled. "And what did you do to my net, anyway?"

"Oh, that," Elysia said, waving her butterbeer dismissively. "_Stör störningar._ Got that from my mum's old school notes. It's a degenerate form of _Evanesco;_ same wand movement, too. Only works on conjurations, though, and it's not a clean Vanishing so much as it destabilizes the thaumic matrix. Usually it causes the target to blink in and out of phase for a bit before going up in smoke. Not terribly useful, but Mum thought it looked cool, so she kept a copy. Dunno why it's in Swedish, though."

"It makes the Arithmancy a bit easier," Luna chimed in. "The Latin would be longer, too."

Elysia nodded gratefully. "Makes sense. Thanks, Luna-love."

"Speaking of spells," Izzy chimed in. "What did you hit us all with right at the start? It left me twitchy for like half a lap!"

"That's a bit of a long story, actually," Elysia said sheepishly.

"It must be," Fleur said. "Lightning magic is ze stuff of myth!"

Hermione snorted. "That's only because anti-lightning wards are overly broad, and nobody bothered to update them over the centuries."

Izzy stared. "Wait, _seriously?_ Those things are _everywhere!_ Why didn't they just use lightning rods?"

"That's what _I_ said!" Hermione agreed. "Anyway, we fixed it."

"_What._" Cedric said.

Luna giggled. "We fixed it! There's a lightning rod at Hogwarts now, and the wards are fixed."

"By 'we'," Anna asked, slowly, "you mean your professors, right?"

Elysia winked. "That'd be telling."

"That's a 'no' if I ever heard one," Izzy muttered.

"And anyway," Luna continued, "Professor Snape is ecstatic about it. He actually did a happy-dance when he found out."

"That might have been because muggle electronics work here now," Hermione said. 

"Is _that_ why he's been so much nicer this year?" Cedric asked.

"Nah, he only found out a week ago," Elysia said. "The lightning ward's been fixed all term. We've been having movie nights and everything."

"Ohmygosh, have you seen _Jurassic Park_ yet?" Izzy gushed. "It just came out on tape last month!"

Hermione's eyes gleamed.

Elysia giggled. "Hey Robbie? Think you can snag a copy by tonight?"

"No problem!" Robbie said, snapping a jaunty salute.

"Awesome! Movie night in the Room tonight, then! You lot care to join us?" Elysia asked.

"Yeah!" Izzy bounced gleefully in her seat.

"Alright," Anna agreed.

"*Ahem,*" Rita interjected. "You were saying about the lightning spell?"

"Oh, right. The chain-lightning stunner." Elysia grinned a bit sheepishly. "Bit of a family secret, that, sorry. You can't expect me to give away _all_ of my tricks, after all."

"A girl can dream," Rita retorted.

"And maybe someday that dream will come true," Elysia agreed. "But not in the middle of the Games! There's still five more Tasks to go, y'know, and I _am_ still the youngest competitor. This lot would stomp me flat if I didn't have _something_ to even the playing field."

Cedric snorted.

"What?" Elysia gave him a look. "Why do you think I went for sheer speed? I didn't want to get caught in cursing range!"

"Why don't I believe you?" Fleur muttered.

"Because you've seen me furious?" Elysia retorted.

"That would do it," Hermione said.



-----



They talked for a little while longer, covering the exploits of each of the champions in turn. Finally, the siren song of lunch proved too irresistible, and they adjourned to the Great Hall while Robbie popped away to acquire a copy of _Jurassic Park._

That night after dinner, Izzy, Anna, and Fleur all joined Elysia's usual Movie Night group. (Cedric begged off as he already had plans with Cho, and Krum had grumbled that he had no interest in such idle frivolities -- which got an eyeroll out of everyone who heard.) They all sat around chatting after the movie, and Hermione explained that, while muggles couldn't clone extinct animals _yet,_ it was probably only a matter of time.[^3] The wizard-raised among them were shocked that muggles had their own form of bio-alchemy, and even more shocked that it was so developed. 

Ron also wondered what a dino-steak would taste like, and Fred & George had disturbing grins for most of the night. Elysia resolved to be more wary than usual where they were concerned.



[^3]: [Dolly the Sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_(sheep)) was cloned from mature cells in 1996, with the by-then-extinct Pyrenean ibex following in 2009. While this isn't _quite_ the same technique as used in _Jurassic Park,_ it's close enough to prove Hermione's point.



-----



The next two weeks were surprisingly uneventful. The girls spent a portion of every morning training at the Kiln, and most mornings Sirius joined them. Sirius got Elysia to give Remus the Secret to the Kiln the following weekend, and she spent an enjoyable day catching up. Remus also performed the Unlimited Flight ritual, though because of his lycanthropy he couldn't become a shifter yet. He kept making _Airwolf_ jokes, though nobody else got them.

That Sunday, Elysia and company happened to be in the Three Broomsticks when Hagrid passed by and surreptitiously dropped a note on her lap, covering it with his usual exuberant greeting.

_Wow, that was downright cunning for Hagrid,_ Hermione sent. _What's it say?_

_He wants me to meet him just before midnight, with my invisibility cloak,_ Elysia replied.

_Think it's about the next Task?_ Luna asked.

_Probably,_ Elysia sent. _Bit concerning, considering._

The others sent agreement tinged with trepidation.



-----



That night, Elysia shadow-walked to Hagrid's doorstep with her cloak on, knocking three quick knocks. The door opened swiftly. 

"That you, Ellie?" Hagrid said, stepping out. He wore a flower in his button-hole, and had broken teeth from some poor comb stuck in his hair (which Elysia surreptitiously Vanished for him).

"It's me," she said, flipping back the cloak's hood.

"Righ'," Hagrid said. "Stay quiet, stay hidden, and stay close. There's summat ye should see."

"Gotcha," she said, flipping the hood back into place and casting a few stealth charms.

Hagrid led her over to the Beauxbatons carriage, where Madame Maxime met him with a smile. She wrapped a shawl around her shoulders, and they set off for what seemed to be a romantic moonlit stroll in the Forbidden Forest. 

Elysia followed them to a secluded set of paddocks tucked away in the forest, where great gouts of flame lit the night amidst shouting. As they drew closer, she could make out -- 

_Dragons!?_

_What._ Luna sent.

_There's a bunch of dragons in the forest! Hang on, Charlie Weasley's here too. Apparently the next Task is to get something out of the dragon's nest. Thank Merlin, I was afraid I'd be expected to kill the poor thing!_

Luna's relief was palpable. _So what do you think? Fast, flashy, effective, pick two?_

Elysia sent a mental smirk. _Why choose? Time to show off another lightning spell._

Luna cackled.



-----



The next week, quite a bit of time was spent in Elysium running scenarios and choreography. None of them knew for sure what the final layout of the Task would be, so Elysia ran timing drills with _tximista ibili,_ the Lightning Leap spell. She'd decided on entering to AC/DC's _Thunderstruck,_ and since she didn't expect this task to take very long at all, timed her leaps to the song.

Since she'd seen not only Madame Maxime with Hagrid, but also Karkaroff skulking around in the shadows, it was likely the other schools' champions already knew about the dragons. She'd thought about mentioning it to Cedric, but he was always with Cho, it seemed, in a world of their own, so she finally resorted to having Robbie leave a note on his pillow. And by then it was already Thursday.

She wasn't too worried. Both Sirius and Remus would be there, and Sirius at least could handle a dragon no problem, if any of the other champions ran into trouble. Not to mention Dumbledore, little though she trusted him.

By the time Saturday rolled around, Elysia felt like she could finish off the Second Task in her sleep.



-----

### Hex Games Stadium, Hogwarts Grounds, Scotland	1994/11/26	10:00

"It's another fine day here at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!" Ludo Bagman's voice boomed out. "Welcome, one and all, to the Second Task of the Hex Games!"

Elysia and the other champions had been sequestered in a tent a short walk away from the arena, and had been made to draw a numbered, animated miniature of a dragon from a sack. Elysia had drawn a tiny Ukrainian Ironbelly with a number 3 around its neck. Fitting, she'd thought, considering her favorite outfit.

"Now then," Bagman had said once they'd all drawn. "Your objective is to retrieve the golden egg, which if you can solve it is a hint for the Fourth Task. This is a test of your nerve and ability to think on your feet, so you'll only be allowed to bring your wands in."

Elysia took off her glasses and pendant, calling Robbie to hold them for her during the Task. "Are sizing-charmed clothes okay?" She asked Bagman.

"Oh, sure," he'd said. "As long as you don't try to put them on the dragon!" They'd laughed, and he'd left to begin announcing the event.

("Oh good," Izzy said, trying to look innocent.)

She'd flopped down on her stomach on the tent's floor to play with the tiny Ironbelly, which was small enough to sit in her hand like a kitten. Izzy joined her with her own tiny dragon, a Norwegian Ridgeback, as Krum was called out to face the Welsh Green. Fleur and Anna were sitting like twin statues, tension only visible if you knew what to look for.

"How can you lot be so calm about this?" Cedric railed, pacing back and forth and running his hands through his hair.

"Well, it's a bit late to panic now, innit?" Elysia retorted, stroking the Ironbelly's snout.

"But it's a _dragon!_" Cedric exclaimed.

"And you without a will?" Elysia said. "You _do_ know people have died in past tournaments, right?"

"It just never hit me quite like this before," Cedric admitted.

"Better now than when you're staring down its jaws."

"Are you _trying_ to psych me out?" Cedric growled.

Elysia winked. "Is it working?"

"Yes!" He yelled.

Anna snorted. "Be glad you didn't get the Horntail."



-----



"Next up, our youngest competitor, Elysia Potter!" Bagman announced.

Robby pressed Play and hit the boom-box with a _sonorous._ The opening strains of AC/DC's _Thunderstruck_ began to ring out across the stadium.

_Go time,_ Elysia thought, entering the arena in time with the beat as the first verse started. The muggle-raised attendees were on their feet, stamping and shouting along, to the bemusement of the others (not to mention the enormous dragon across the arena). She played her own variation of the classic drinking game, and every time the song said "thunder!" she'd cast 球電 (_kyuu-den,_ a Japanese ball-lightning spell). The orbs flared to the melody. The audience loved it, and the dragon was entranced, moving like a charmed cobra as its head followed the orbs around the arena.

She hopped up on a boulder for a better angle as the minute-fifty mark arrived. "You've been --" Brian Johnson's screech echoed across the stadium, and Elysia raised her wand, tapping her foot in time and muttering "_tximista ibili_."

The drums kicked in, and with them an echoing double-boom of thunder as she leapt across the arena to the golden egg in a bolt of lightning, scooped it up, and then rode another bolt to the arena's exit. The remaining orbs of ball-lightning exploded in showers of sparks.

"Thunderstruck!" The crowd yelled.

Elysia raised the egg high above her head, then bowed with a flourish. The crowd roared, the music faded out, and she sauntered off to be swept into a bone-crushing double-hug from her girlfriends.

In the distance, she heard the dragon hiss, "what the _fuck_ was that!?"

"The Green-Eyed Lightning does it again!" Bagman shouted. "Our youngest champion is by far the fastest to retrieve her egg, in a stunning and flawless performance! Let's go to the judges!" He waved his wand, and a large, glowing '10' appeared. The others followed suit. Even Karkaroff couldn't find fault; he had a sour look on his face as he gave his score.

Elysia, Luna, and Hermione made their way into the stands to join Remus and Sirius (in disguise again). They looked quite cozy together, and when Elysia raised an eyebrow Remus blushed.

"Hey, who am I to judge?" She said, snuggling between Luna and Hermione. "Anyway, how's the competition so far?"

"Compared to you? Dismal," Sirius said. "Krum tried cursing his dragon in the eye. He made the shot, but she trampled half her eggs and clawed him pretty good before he made it out."

The girls all winced at that.

"Miss Delacour fared somewhat better," Remus picked up the thread. "She put her dragon to sleep somehow --"

 "-- And half the stands --" Sirius cut in.

 "-- But Chinese Fireballs apparently breathe flames when they snore, and her skirt caught fire before she made it out."

 "Who wears a skirt when facing a dragon?" Hermione scoffed. "Honestly!"

 "Hey, it was the most exciting part of the whole thing!" Ron protested, from the next row down. He was promptly smacked upside the head by Ginny, who then went back to cuddling with Nell on her other side.

"Anyway, they're both back in the healers' tent," Remus added.

("When did _that_ happen?" Elysia nudged Hermione, gesturing to Nell and Ginny.

"The night you went to see Hagrid," she answered. "Nell was in a bit of a panic at first and asked my advice."

"Good for them," Luna said, snuggling closer herself.)

"The handlers have switched dragons," Bagman boomed, "and now it's time for Durmstrang's second champion, Anna Kozlov!"

> To Do:
>
> - [x] Deal with the dragon in the Second Task



-----



The next two champions put on a good show, Elysia had to give them that. Anna went for a sensory-overload approach, with lots of colored, scented smoke, sparks, loud noises, and a clever disillusionment charm which _almost_ got her through the ordeal unscathed. Unfortunately, Hungarian Horntails are aptly-named, and she was caught by a tail-horn as she made her escape. It went straight through her left arm and sent her flying halfway to the exit.

Elysia winced. She knew from experience that Anna was looking at a night on skele-grow at minimum for that, and resolved to drop in on her later to help break up the painful monotony of re-growing an arm.

Izzy, mad little ball of energy that she was, did something _nobody_ saw coming. She cast an engorgement charm on herself until she was as big as the dragon (a familiar-looking Norwegian Ridgeback), then went hand-to-claw with her: first punching her in the snout as the dragon reared back to breathe a gout of flame, then suplexing her and putting her in a dorsal body-lock with a choke-hold until the dragon passed out. Then she simply dispelled the _engorgio,_ picked up her egg, and swaggered out of the arena.

"Holy fuck," Elysia breathed.

"And _we're_ the scary ones?" Luna asked rhetorically.

("Norberta!" Hagrid wailed.

"Norberta!?" Hermione asked. "_Seriously?_")

"Did- did that just happen?" Bagman stammered.

Needless to say, Izzy also got a perfect score.

After that, Cedric really didn't stand much chance. He kept transfiguring boulders into livestock, attempting to draw the Hebridean Black away from her nest, but she was having none of it. Eventually, he switched tactics, transfiguring a bull which charged the dragon. Using that as a distraction, he skulked along the edge of the arena, then bolted for the nest. He'd just grabbed the golden egg and made a break for it when the dragon noticed him, sending a wash of flames over him. He stumbled out of the arena and was immediately whisked to the healers' tent.



-----



With four of the six champions sequestered away in the hospital wing for the next few days, Rita Skeeter had to content herself with the two stars of the Second Task, Elysia and Izzy.

"So, Miss Maradona," Skeeter began. "Can you tell me _what in the name of Magic_ you were thinking?"

"Yeah, Izzy, you _suplexed a dragon._ Just. _Seriously?_" Elysia added.

"What, like you have a monopoly on arse-kicking?" Izzy retorted. "Like the saying says, 'go big or go home.' I went big."

"Yeah you did!" Luna giggled.

"That was one of the hottest things I've ever seen!" Elysia gushed, her girlfriends nodding emphatically alongside her.

Izzy blushed, but grinned. "Coming from Miss 'Hero Landing' that means a lot."

It was Elysia's turn to blush as her girlfriends giggled.

"You'll have to watch out for Charlie Weasley," Hermione said. "He's one of the dragon-handlers. Dunno if he'd want to kill you or kiss you for actually pulling off what you did."

"Either way, not gonna happen," Izzy said, laughing.

"So you've trained in muggle martial arts, Miss Maradona?" Rita asked.

"A few," Izzy replied. "Jiu-jitsu, mostly."

"I thought I recognized that hold!" Elysia said.

Izzy cocked an eyebrow. "You train too?"

Elysia nodded. "Yeah. Some jiu-jitsu, some soft-style kung fu, a few others."

"We should spar sometime!" Izzy gushed.

"Might could do," Elysia said. "Maybe we could make our wandless duel a _kumite_ match!"

Izzy held out her little finger. "I love it! Pinky pact!"

The two girls shook pinkies on it.

"I look forward to seeing that," Rita said.

"You need a nickname, Izzy" Luna suddenly said.

"Yeah!" Elysia agreed. "Hmm. What was that wand core of yours from again?"

"A matagot?" Izzy asked.

"That's it!" Hermione cried. "Izabella 'The Matagot' Maradona!"

"Perfect," Luna agreed sagely.

"Yeah, alright! It _does_ flow nicely," Izzy agreed.

"That settles it, then," Rita said.
