## Chapter 5: Was This A Date?

The next day, Elysia noticed an addition to her to-do list. 

> To Do
>
> - [x] Find and read Divination And Privacy: Information Control In The Magical World
> - [ ] Examine the blood wards Dumbledore claims to have put on #4 Privet Drive

*Wait, blood wards? Is* that *why Dumbledore keeps sending me back here?*

After reading the primer and finishing their morning workout, she and Robbie started poking around the Dursley home for wards, and potential anchors. Pushing her magic into her eyes, she activated what ward-crafters and curse-breakers called Mage-Sight, allowing her to see visual representations of magical manifestations which would otherwise be invisible -- such as ward-lines, which in this case glowed a deep, pulsing blood-red. They followed the ward traces to a flag-stone in the back garden, one of the path leading to the tool-shed.

Flipping it over, they found a relatively straightforward ward schema and a smear of red. She checked the adjacent stones, too, just in case, but they were blank. *Hmm, possibilities,* she thought.

Between the two of them, they were able to decode the ward schema. It was, in Elysia's divinely-expert opinion, amateurish at best. "Owl redirection, mage-repelling -- inverted muggle-repelling, really -- with intent-based blacklist, a clever little modified _fidelius,_ some ties to what I'm assuming is my blood there... a life-monitor, remote notifier link, ooh, *nasty* anti-Dark Mark ward... an arithmantic descriptor array -- for the blood protection thing, looks like..."

"Are those *emotion-amplifiers?*" Robbie gasped incredulously.

"What the -- they *are!* And linked to the familial descriptor array, as if it's meant to amplify familial bonds, but... I'm not in that array. And it amplifies *all* emotions, not just positive ones. And that's only linked as 'targets,' not with any specifics... Oh, that's just *sloppy!*"

"That explains why the Dursleys are such caricatures of normality, I suppose," Robbie said.

A cold tingle crawled across Elysia's scalp, and she replaced the ward stone. "I get the feeling we should leave this alone for now," she told Robbie. "Could be useful as evidence or something later."



-----



The summer fell into a rhythm fairly quickly. Elysia had gotten into good enough shape that she'd been able to read the primers for more hard-style martial arts, like jiu jitsu, krav maga, and Shaolin animal-style kung fu. She'd moved on to 'Elysia's Combat Style: Stage 2,' which touched heavily on jeet kun do. Mornings were spent training with Robbie, and afternoons were spent on everything else: reading her family's journals, writing to friends, fiddling around with projects, finishing up summer homework, and frequently meeting up with Hermione. After coming out to her, Elysia no longer felt the need to shift into her 'Harry' shape around Hermione, and they both got used to Elysia's girl-ness surprisingly quickly.

Elysia found that she really enjoyed enchanting. She spent quite a bit of time making some enhancements to her new glasses, such as adding night-vision, false-color thermal, 'x-ray' vision, zoom, Mage-Sight augmentation, and a thaumic analytics HUD -- she was particularly pleased with this project, as all of these enhancements were etched on a separate schema stone she'd shrunk down and wore as a pendant, and then tied into the glasses. This gave her lots of room to add features later, too.

She and Robbie took advantage of the other flagstones to add to the wards -- aside from a self-erase on the newly-added wardstone (set to trigger either whenever the original stone was flipped, or via long-distance triggering charm), they also added Trace shielding -- which was probably illegal for a muggle house, but then again so were blood wards. And both Elysia and Robbie felt that, since pure-blood children could practice magic all they liked without consequence outside of school, the law was a farce in the first place. Still, coupling it with a notice-me-not/*confundus* hybrid ward was downright inspired, Elysia thought. That particular combination, one of Robbie's ideas, would make any visible spells register to muggles as just Dudley mucking around with fireworks or, if inside, something on the telly.

Hermione had expressed (vocally and at great length) the desire to learn some of what Elysia could now do, so Elysia began teaching her the basics of both mind magic and free-form wandless casting. As part of these, she and Robbie also started teaching Hermione some martial arts, particularly tai chi as it lent itself well to spell-channeling.

They still made time to have fun, though. It was a good summer for cinema. Neither Elysia nor Robbie had ever been before, so Hermione had taken them both to see *The Lion King,* *Baby's Day Out,* *Little Rascals,* *Forrest Gump,* and *The Mask* (which Robbie particularly enjoyed).

Robbie had wanted to examine the pedestal building at The Kiln again (and give the two friends some time without Elysia's 'brother' tagging along, he confided to her), so Elysia and Hermione saw *Black Beauty* just the two of them.

*Why does this feel like a date?* They both thought, walking out of the theater. Not that either of them had ever actually been on a date, but their hands had kept brushing while they were sharing a tub of popcorn, and neither girl was sure if it had been entirely accidental or not.

By now, Robbie and Elysia's bond had progressed to the point that they could, with effort, send messages to each other telepathically. So when Hermione asked if Elysia would stay for dinner, she let Robbie know and barely avoided blushing visibly at the smirk he sent back.

"Ugh, brothers," she grumbled good-naturedly to Hermione, as they walked through Crawley back to the Granger residence.

"What about Robbie now?" Hermione asked.

"Just teasing me a bit, is all," Elysia said. "It's amazing to see how much more self-assured he is compared to two years ago, or even the beginning of summer hols."

"You too, Ellie. Is that the bond's doing, do you think, or just different circumstances?"

"A bit of both, I suppose. Anyone'd do better away from the Malfoys or Durzkaban. But the bond probably has a pretty big effect. I know my work ethic's increased, too, probably as a side-effect. Did I tell you I wrote McGonagall? She's letting me drop Divination if I can test into Arithmancy and Runes. Which I can. I could test *out* of Arithmancy if I read far enough in my mindscape library, but if I do that for classes I'm actually taking, school will be *so boring.* As it is, I do have the math down, just not the applications."

"And also, this way we share a class just the two of us," Hermione smiled.

"That too, yeah." Elysia smiled back. They both blushed and looked away.

"*Ahem.* So, the bond," Hermione said quickly. "How exactly does that impact your and Robbie's personalities so much?"

"There's a few things that go into it, really. Do they go over the waveform model of magic in third-year Arithmancy?"

"The what?"

Elysia sighed. "Okay, this is going to be more complicated than I'd thought. Let's see, analogies... D'you know how light and radio and magnetism and all that can be thought of as waves? Well, magic is like that too."

Hermione looked startled, then got a thoughtful expression on her face. "Go on."

"The other thing you need to know is that magic comes from the soul, more-or-less. Power comes from internal harmony of intent. The stronger, more unified, more *in sync,* I guess, your intent is, the more powerful the magic is as a direct result."

"More focused, maybe?" Hermione queried. "Like a laser?"

"Exactly!" Elysia exclaimed. "Magic's all about focus and willpower. Past a certain threshold, it starts to self-reinforce. A bond is a magical connection, and so works similarly. And since the parameters of the bond are defined by the oath, it tends to reinforce things related to the oath. The waveform model makes a whole lot of things about magic make more sense, really, even if it *is* just an abstraction and not totally accurate... What?" She asked, warily, as Hermione was staring at her with a funny look on her face.

"I like this new you," Hermione said. "I always knew you were smart, but it's *wonderful* to be able to have conversations like this with you. Before this summer, most of our conversations were taken up with homework, quidditch, or whatever crisis of the moment. Now... you just seem more comfortable in your own skin. More confident, more driven. More playful, too. Happier. I don't know, maybe that's just growing up. But I don't think it's *only* that."

Elysia was silent for a little while, thinking. She hadn't thought about it much after the first couple of days, but she really had changed a *lot* over the summer. Her birthday had been a few weeks ago, her first as Elysia, and all of the cards and such were addressed to 'Harry' except Hermione's. Her Hogwarts letter, which had also arrived that day, was the same. It was jarring to think that that name still referred to her, and by necessity would continue to until she could change it upon reaching her majority.

She still hadn't told Ron about most of it, either. Not that she was a girl, nor that she was a shape-shifter, nor the past-life knowledge. She'd mentioned Robbie, and some of the things from the vault (though not the money or the trunk), but not The Kiln or all the time she was spending with Hermione. And none of that had occurred to her *at all* until just now. It struck her all at once that she was growing apart from her first friend, and she *really* didn't know how to feel about that.

"Merlin and Morgana, I really *have* changed," she breathed. "Hermione, I've not told Ron about hardly *any* of this!"

"I can just see his eyes glazing over if you did, though," Hermione replied.

"No, I mean hardly *anything* about this summer. I haven't even told him I'm a girl!"

Hermione stopped dead in her tracks.

"Or the past-life knowledge, or the shifting, or even the trunk!" Elysia continued, before noticing that Hermione wasn't beside her anymore. "Um, Hermione?"

"Oh no, I forgot you're famous! And I know how much you hate all of that, but Ellie, you *know* people are going to make a fuss about anything you do. And how do magicals even think about trans people, anyway? Is it even an issue? So much else is pre-Victorian, so maybe not, but..."

Elysia couldn't help but smile. "Breathe, Hermione. I got through that Heir of Slytherin hogwash, didn't I?"

Hermione took a deep breath, and smiled sheepishly. "You're right, it's not quite life-or-death, is it?"

"I don't suppose so," Elysia said. "Still, it's something I should have at least given *some* thought before now. I guess I just felt that if *you* were okay with it all, the rest didn't really matter."

Hermione smiled bashfully. "I'm flattered."

"I don't suppose that's really fair to Ron, though, is it?" Elysia continued.

"Well, maybe not, but he *is* a bloke," Hermione said. "And Ron can be a particularly *insensitive* bloke sometimes."

"That's true. Oh, that reminds me. I wanted to apologize for being such a git over that Firebolt last Christmas. You were only looking out for me, like you always do. You deserve better than my throwing a tantrum over it. And anyway, you were right," she grinned, "it *was* sent by Sirius."

"Of course I was right. I'm *always* right," Hermione said with mock solemnity.

"We'll have to make that the Hogwarts Mantra," Elysia said. "'Hermione is always right. I will listen to Hermione. I will not ignore Hermione's recommendations. Hermione is God. If this ever happens again, Hermione will personally rip your lungs out.'"

Hermione stuck her tongue out, then giggled. "I didn't know you'd seen _Babylon 5!_"

"I haven't, not really. Just heard a bit here and there when Dudley had the telly up too loud. That bit stuck because I thought it was hilarious."

"It objectively is, though! The entire show is quotable like that. Maybe it'll be out on tape someday and we can watch it together. I wonder..."

"Are you thinking about how to get a VHS and a telly to work inside Hogwarts too?"

Hermione smirked. "Maybe..."

By this time, they'd made it back to the Granger residence. They were just about to enter when Hermione suddenly spun around and hugged Elysia tightly.

"Um, 'Mione?" Elysia asked as the other witch let go. "What was that for?"

"Do I need a reason to hug my best friend?" She replied. "Besides, are you really objecting?"

"Never," Elysia stated firmly. "You couldn't *Imperius* me to object to one of your hugs."

Smiling brightly, Hermione led the way inside.



### Granger House, Crawley	1994/08/20	17:36

Elysia was nervous. Since they both worked, she'd only met Hermione's parents, Emerson and Danika ("call me Dani, everyone does"), a couple of times before, and never had a chance for much in the way of conversation with them. And now she was staring down the barrel of not only an entire meal's worth of such, but also coming out to them.

*Breathe,* she told herself. *Hermione's right here. She's got your back. She always does.*

Hermione's parents were just finishing up in the kitchen. "Hullo, you two," her mother called. "You're just in time."

They all sat around the dinner table as Emerson brought in the main course, a pot roast.

"So," he said as he took his seat. "You're the mysterious Elysia we've been hearing so much about this summer."

"It's so lovely to see Hermione having a friend to do things with in the summer," Dani gushed. "How did you two meet, anyway?"

"Um, we met on the train to Hogwarts back in first year," Elysia said hesitantly.

"Oh? Odd that she's never mentioned you before now," Dani said.

"Only ever those two boys, Ron and Harry," Emerson said. "Mostly Harry, really," he added with a smirk at his daughter.

Elysia gave Hermione a look, one eyebrow raised high. Hermione bit her lip and busied herself with her food, refusing to meet Elysia's eyes.

"Why Hermione, I didn't know you cared," she teased. Turning back to the Drs. Granger, she said, "As it happens, she *has* mentioned me. I'm Harry. Or, I was, I suppose. I'm transgender. Didn't click that I was a girl 'til after all the fuss up at school was over for the year, but then once I twigged to it, things moved pretty fast."

The Granger parents seemed shocked, but not, Elysia hoped, in a bad way.

"It turns out I have latent shape-shifting abilities," she continued. "Found my parents' journals, put a few things together, and, well..." She shifted into Harry-shape and waved shyly at them before shifting back.

"My goodness!" Dani gasped. 

"Well. This is a lot to take in," Emerson said. "But I thought you kids weren't allowed to use magic outside of school?"

"We're not allowed to use *wands* outside of school, sir, aside from in an emergency," Elysia replied. "There are plenty of other ways to use magic -- such as runes, potions, wandless casting, and innate abilities like my shape-shifting."

"How fascinating! Could you possibly show us some of that? We've never had a chance to see what Hermione's been learning up at school because of that law," Dani said.

Elysia was nonplussed. "You're really okay with me being a girl? Just like that?"

"You *do* seem much happier than last we saw you, hon, and that's the important thing," Dani replied.

Elysia smiled in relief. Hermione patted her arm, and said, "Well, after we eat, how about we show you what Ellie's been teaching me this summer?"

After dinner, they all moved into the living room, where Hermione showed off some wandless magic, Elysia turned into various animals, and the two of them demonstrated a magically-augmented round of a tai chi exercise called Push Hands. Just as they finished, Hedwig and a tiny little ball of energy (that may or may not have been an owl) flew in with letters from Ron for the two girls.

> Harry,
>
> Dad's managed to get tickets to the Quidditch World Cup final, and Top Box at that! Someone at work owed him a favor, so we're all going ('cept Mum), and there's tickets for you and Hermione too. He even made sure there was room for Robbie, though since he's a house-elf he won't need a ticket.
>
> Anyway, the match is the day after tomorrow, and Mum says you and Hermione can stay with us for the rest of Break. 
>
> Dad said he can pick you up from the Dursleys, but it might be easier if Robbie could bring you. You know how Dad gets.
>
> See you soon!

>
> ​    - Ron

Elysia and Hermione looked at each other.

"You're not going to subject Mr. Weasley and the Dursleys to each other, are you, Ellie?" Hermione asked.

"Merlin, no! Mr. Weasley's a sweet man, but he's a bit... *something* when it comes to Muggle things," Elysia responded. "Uncle Vernon would have a stroke. Robbie?"

Robbie popped into the Grangers' living room. "You rang, Ellie?"

"Hey, bro. Robbie, these are Hermione's parents." Elysia said, making introductions. "Anyway, Ron's invited us -- you, me, and Hermione -- to stay for the rest of summer, and to join them at the Quidditch World Cup final. Top Box, even. Mr. Weasley offered to pick us up, but..."

Robbie snorted. "But the Dursleys. No worries, I'll just pop us over and save everyone the trouble. Noon-ish?"

"Works for me. Hermione? Drs. Granger?"

Hermione turned honest-to-Morgana *puppy eyes* on her parents. "Please, Mum and Dad?"

Hermione's parents looked at each other and laughed. "Goodness, Hermione, I thought you didn't like quidditch if Har - er, Elysia wasn't playing," Dani teased.

Hermione blushed bright enough to show clearly through her caramel complexion. "But, Mum, it's an international event! Think of the cultural experience!"

Elysia and Emerson shared a grin. "Never change, Hermione," Elysia said fondly.



-----



That night, Elysia popped into her mindscape to speak with the memory-constructs of her parents. At the same time, Hermione sought out her own parents.

"Mum, Dad, can I talk to you?"

"Of course, sweetie, what is it?"

"... I think I'm starting to fall for my best friend."
