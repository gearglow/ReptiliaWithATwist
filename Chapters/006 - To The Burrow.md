## Chapter 6: To The Burrow

### #4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey	1994/08/21	11:55

The next morning, Elysia wrote to her godfather, Sirius Black. While they'd exchanged a couple of letters over the summer, she'd told him even less than she had Ron thus far. She'd thought about it, sure, but so much had happened that she didn't even know where to start. She finally wrote about the Quidditch World Cup and that she and Hermione could be reached care of the Weasleys for the rest of the summer, and sent Hedwig on her way.

That done, she decided to pop into Elysium and check in with Janet. As she appeared in the study, Janet walked in from the hallway. "Oh good, you're here. There are some important things you need to know before you return to the magical world."

Elysia got comfortable in one of the chairs as Janet assumed her lecturing stance. "First, Albus Dumbledore is not your friend. He's manipulated you since before you were even born."

Elysia gasped, whether in shock our outrage she wasn't sure.

"There was a prophecy made about you and Voldemort," Janet continued. "A fake one, I might add -- and he's taken it to mean that you need to sacrifice yourself in order for Voldemort to finally be defeated for good. So he manipulated events to, first, bring the child of the prophecy to light -- it could have been either you or Neville Longbottom -- and then, once it was clear (to him, anyway) that the prophecy referred to you, he had you raised in such a way that you'd be willing to sacrifice yourself to defeat Voldemort without a second thought. He's desperate, not necessarily malicious, but he's also been drinking his own Kool-Aid, and he's developed a severe case of tunnel vision where you and Voldemort are concerned."

"But... *why?* Why does he think that I have to die?"

"Because of the piece of Voldemort's soul that was in your scar, that anchors him to this world. He can't die while they still exist. He's made several, through the darkest of magic, but the one in your scar was unintentional and he never even knew about it. We'll get back to the others, but the one on your scar was removed before you were sent back."

"But Dumbledore doesn't know that, right?"

"Exactly, so he'll still try and manipulate you to his own ends. In your last life, he even resorted to potions after this year to prevent any attachments strong enough to give you the desire to live instead of sacrificing yourself. You've changed enough already that he might do that sooner, so you need to know how to counteract them. And teach Hermione too; she's close enough to you that she's a target for him as well. And one other, but you haven't met her yet."

"Not Ron?" Elysia asked.

"No, not Ron," Janet confirmed. "The entire Weasley family has unquestioning faith in Dumbledore. Even if they knew about his meddling, they'd think it for the best, and go along with it without a second thought."

"So, what, should I just walk away from the whole family because they're too trusting? From my first friend?"

"No, of course not," Janet said. "Just don't expect them to pick you over the Headmaster if it comes to that. He's infallible to them, despite all evidence to the contrary. People believe what they want to believe, and magicals are even more prone to this sort of thinking, culturally speaking."

"I should probably act like as little has changed as possible, then," Elysia mused. "Show too much independence and it sounds like he'll start getting heavy-handed."

"Most likely," Janet confirmed. "He *is* the one who went against your parents' wills and had you placed with the Dursleys. Left you, a toddler who could already climb, on the doorstep in a basket, in *November,* no less. You could have frozen, or wandered into traffic. And he sealed the wills so nobody would find out. Also, he's the one who cast the *Fidelius* charm to hide your parents. He *knew* Sirius was innocent."

"What!?" Elysia shrieked.

"He'd claim Sirius' incarceration was a 'necessary evil' to keep you safely hidden under impenetrable blood-wards tied to your mother's sacrifice. He's not a malicious man, Elysia. He has good intentions. But as the saying goes, the road to Hell is paved with those, and Dumbledore is rather far down his own personal highway."

"Lovely. So what's this about soul pieces, then?" Elysia asked, changing the subject. She was feeling horribly betrayed, and didn't want to deal with it yet.

"They're called horcruxes," Janet said. "Voldemort made six intentionally. You already destroyed one, the diary in your second year."

"Merlin! And there are *five more* of those things lying around?" Elysia exclaimed. "Glad I got to enjoy this summer, because it sounds like it was the last carefree one I'm going to get for awhile."

"That's why you insisted we give you this one," Janet agreed. "Anyway, The List has an appendix on the details of the horcruxes. You won't be able to do much about most of them yet, but The List will update when you can."

Elysia threw herself backwards into the chair. "No pressure, then," she said morosely.

Janet smiled sadly. "I know it's a lot. And it's only the tip of the iceberg, though the rest isn't as urgent."

Elysia cocked an eyebrow. "Now what?"

"Magical society is stagnating," Janet replied, "in large part because of Dumbledore's policies -- and Magic is dying because of it. And _you,_" she continued, "are the one Destiny has chosen to fix it -- _by any means necessary._ If you have to become a tyrant and drag the entire magical world kicking and screaming into the 21st century through a sea of blood, then that's what it takes. Destiny's given you a blank check on the other side. Though obviously, if you can avoid the sea of blood and such, that'd be preferable."

"I'm sure," Elysia said faintly, eyes wide.

"You don't have to worry about that part yet," Janet reassured her. "Just focus on Voldemort for now. The thing about death by stagnation is that it takes awhile. You've got time."

"Why me?" Elysia moaned, face in her hands.

"You asked Destiny that yourself, before coming back," Janet said. "You're a pivot point in the time-stream, and so are ideally-placed to change things."

"Oh. Wait a minute, Destiny's a _person?_"

"Yup!" Janet replied. "Well, _personification,_ really. And Eleanor is right -- Destiny really does rock the Little Black Dress. Reminds me of Posh Spice a bit, actually."

"Who?"

"Oh, right. Give it a couple of years. You'll find out."

Elysia sighed. "You just like bewildering me, don't you?"

"Confusion means your brain is learning!" Janet sang.

"Oh, and one more thing," she added. "There's going to be a bit of a Death Eater reunion the night of the match. Someone will cast the Dark Mark which will cause them all to apparate away. Plan accordingly."

There being nothing to pack, what with all her and Robbie's worldly possessions fitting handily in the magically-expanded residential trunk, the two spent the morning in their usual training routine -- and in Elysia's case, bleeding off the tension from the morning's revelations. When noon rolled around, Elysia shifted into her androgynous Harry-shape and, after shrinking the trunk and pocketing it, headed downstairs to inform her relatives that she would be leaving for the rest of the summer. She found them at the table, just starting in on lunch.

"Where'd you get those clothes!?" Dudley accused.

"Stole them, no doubt," Vernon said.

"Birthday present from my godfather," Elysia lied smoothly. "You know, Sirius Black? The escaped mass-murderer?"

The Dursleys paled. "Er, right," Vernon choked out.

"Anyway, just wanted to let you know. I'm leaving to stay with some school friends for the rest of the summer, and I'll get to the school from there on my own."

"What makes you think you're in any position to just come in here and *tell* us what you're doing, *boy?*" Vernon growled.

"I learned something interesting this summer," Elysia said, grinning evilly. "You know how I'm not allowed to use a wand outside of school?"

Vernon nodded cautiously.

Elysia snapped her fingers, conjuring a ball of Hermione's favorite bluebell flames in the palm of her hand. "I don't need a wand to do magic. Between that and Sirius, I rather think *you're* the ones who need to re-think their positions, don't you?"

Petunia gasped. Vernon nodded quickly, his many chins jiggling grotesquely. Dudley simply bolted up the stairs.

"Go on, then," Vernon snapped.

Before he could say anything further, Elysia disapparated.



### Granger House, Crawley	1994/08/21	11:59

Elysia and Robbie appeared on the Grangers' doorstep with twin *pops* of displaced air. As Elysia was just about to knock, the door flew open and, with a cry of "Ellie!" suddenly her arms were full of her favorite bushy-haired brunette.

"Hey, 'Mione," Elysia said, squeezing her back. "Ready to go?"

She nodded, finally letting Elysia go before leading the way inside. "Thank you for teaching me that wandless shrinking charm, Ellie! I managed to fit so many more books in my trunk!"

Elysia giggled. "Of course you did. Hullo, Drs. Granger!"

"Hello, Ellie," Dani replied.

"Long time no see," Emerson grinned.

"Ellie, I've just thought of something," Hermione said. "You're not out to the Weasleys yet. Should Robbie and I call you 'Harry' again until that changes?"

Elysia thought for a bit. "Yeah, probably, at least when it's not just us. Not sure I want to let on how much I've changed yet; you know how Ron can get. And anyway, we still don't know how the magical world takes transgender people in general, much less their beloved *Boy-Who-Lived.*" She sneered the last part.

Hermione patted her arm comfortingly. "Well, whatever happens, we'll get through it together."



### The Burrow, Ottery St. Catch-Pole	1994/08/21	12:05

After saying their goodbyes to Hermione's parents, Robbie popped the three of them to the lane outside the Burrow's front gate. Elysia was still in Harry-shape, and Robbie was still in human-shape as they'd come from a muggle area. Over their bond, the two giggled at how the Weasleys might react to Robbie's appearance as they walked toward the Burrow's front door. Hermione set Crookshanks down, and, spotting a gnome, he darted off to chase it.

Arthur Weasley opened the door as they approached. "Hello, Harry, Hermione, a- Oh my. Molly?" He called back into the house. "Does Ron have a twin I didn't know about?" He winked at them. "Come in, you lot. Molly's just finished making lunch."

The Burrow was more crowded than usual. It turned out that, when Ron had said that "we're all going ('cept Mum)," he'd meant *all* of the Weasleys (aside from Molly). Ron, Ginny, and the Twins were in the living room chatting with the two oldest Weasley boys, Bill and Charlie.

Ron looked up and caught sight of them. He stopped mid-word, looking back and forth between Elysia and Robbie, and gaping like a particularly large-mouthed fish. "Harry? Bloody hell, mate!"

Ginny looked up, caught sight of Elysia, and blushed bright red.

"Language, Ronald!" Hermione snapped, but she was smirking as she did.

"See, Hermione? I told you it'd be funny," Robbie said.

"Hullo, Weasleys!" Elysia said. "This is Robbie."

Robbie finally shifted back to elf-shape and bowed elaborately, cackling all the while. The twins applauded.

"Quite the entrance, wouldn't you say, Forge?"

"Yes, indeed, Gred."

"Anyway, honorary Weasleys, meet the oldest of the bunch --"

"Bill --"

"And Charlie."

The twins gestured to the oldest two in the room. Charlie was built like the twins: stocky and strong, with callouses visible from across the room and a shiny burn scar on one arm. He had a broad, good-natured face which was covered in freckles.

Bill was a surprise. Elysia had expected an older version of Percy from what Ron had said about him in the past: Head Boy, worked for Gringotts. She'd imagined someone fussy, bossy, and self-important. The reality, though, was that while he was tall and lanky like Percy (and Ron, for that matter) he could easily have been Percy's evil twin. He had long hair pulled back in a ponytail, dragonhide boots, and an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it. All in all, the impression was more rock-star than anything else.

"Nice boots," he said.

Charlie leaned forward excitedly. "Ooh, are those Ukrainian Ironbelly? Ooh, and Hebridean Black?" He added, catching sight of Robbie's ensemble. "Where did you find these?"

"My family's storage vault," Elysia answered. "I got curious after everything last year, so first day back Robbie and I went to Gringotts to see if there was anything interesting. Found a bunch of clothes, my parents' and grandparents' journals, and a few other odds and ends. It's nice to have clothes that actually fit."

Ron had made his way over finally, having replaced his jaw. "Well, you look great, mate," he said, clapping Elysia on the back.

"Lunch is ready, everyone! Please help carry it all out!" Mrs. Weasley called, appearing from the kitchen. "Oh, hello, dears. We're eating out in the garden; there's too many to fit comfortably inside."

Robbie darted over. "I'll bring everything out for you, Mrs. Weasley."

"Thank you... Robbie, I presume?" Mrs. Weasley said. "Harry, Hermione, why don't you take your things up? Harry, you're in Ron's room, and Hermione, you're with Ginny. And bring Percy down with you when you're done, please." She turned back to the kitchen. "Merlin knows that boy works so hard; he needs his energy."



-----



Elysia, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny trooped up the stairs. Ginny and Hermione split off at the first door up the stairs, which was Ginny's room, while the other two continued to the top of the stairs, where Ron's room was.

Elysia hadn't been here since the summer before last, when Ron and the twins had broken her out of Durzkaban after Robbie had ruined one of Vernon's business dinners. It was still awash in Chudley Cannons Orange. Scabbers' -- Wormtail's, rather -- old cage was gone; in its place was a cage containing the ball of owl-shaped energy which had delivered Hermione's invitation last night. The owl was bouncing around the cage and twittering excitedly.

"It's a bit tight in here, sorry," Ron said, squeezing his way in. Somehow there'd been four beds stuffed inside the room. "Fred and George are in here too, because Bill and Charlie have their room," he explained. "Percy gets to keep his all to himself, though, because *he* has to *work.* Git. He *has* an office, you know!"

Elysia just rolled her eyes, pulled out her trunk, un-shrunk it, and shoved it under the bed next to Ron's.



-----



Lunch was a raucous affair. 

It started with Bill and Charlie making the tables duel out on the lawn, causing Percy to stick his head out the window and yell at them to stop making so much noise. Then, with a squeak, Mrs. Weasley's wand turned into a giant rubber mouse, causing her to yell at the twins about something called 'Weasley's Wizard Wheezes.' 

Eventually, everyone had taken their seats. Elysia had Hermione on her right and Robbie on her left, with Bill, Ron, and Ginny across from them. The conversation wandered all over, from Charlie's work with dragons in Romania to Bill's curse-breaking adventures for Gringotts in Egypt, to some of the adventures Elysia, Hermione, and Ron had had at Hogwarts. 

"Wait, the basilisk was *how big?*" Charlie exclaimed.

"'Bout five feet wide, maybe sixty long?" Elysia replied. "Didn't exactly stop to check, you see, on account of the *fangs the size of my arm.*"

"Bloody hell," Charlie breathed.

"Can we change the subject?" Hermione asked, nodding at Ginny, who had gone pale and shaky.

"Please," Elysia said.

"Alright, then," Charlie agreed. "Sorry, Gin. Harry, heard you're Gryffindor's new seeker."

"Youngest in a century," Ron bragged. "He's never failed to catch the snitch, either. Well," he amended, "except for that one time when the dementors swarmed him."

"*Not helping,* Ron," Elysia said through gritted teeth.

"Anyway," Charlie continued, "I was a pretty fair seeker myself, in my day. Care for a seeker's duel?"

Elysia smirked. "You're on!"



-----



When lunch was over, and the aftermath cleared away, everyone trooped down to the clearing in the orchard which was used as a makeshift quidditch pitch by the Weasley kids.

Charlie, riding a brand new Cleansweep 9, pulled out a snitch and grinned. "No hard feelings when I flatten you, eh, Potter?"

Elysia pulled out her shrunken Firebolt. Leaping astride even as it unshrank, she grinned devilishly. "You talk too much, Weasley."

Charlie's eyes bugged out, and he gulped. "A *Firebolt?* You have a *Firebolt!?*" He squeaked.

Ron cackled.

Even going best of five, it was a short duel.



-----



They all went to bed early that night. Mrs. Weasley had offered to pick up Elysia and Hermione's school things, but Elysia was using her mother's old textbooks and Hermione had gone with her parents as soon as the letters had arrived.

"Even the dress robes?" Mrs. Weasley asked Elysia.

"Yes, Mrs. Weasley," Elysia said. "I found some in my parents' storage vault that suit very nicely."

"Well, if you're sure, dear," she said. "Now, get to bed. You'll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup."



-----



"Harry seems different," Ginny said to Hermione as they lay awake that night.

"Oh?" Hermione replied. "How so?"

Ginny tossed and turned for a bit, then rolled over to face Hermione. "Lots of ways. New clothes and such aside, he seems more self-assured, but also less... edgy, I guess? Softer around the edges, somehow. Kind of girly, actually. Not that he's ever been all that buff or anything, just..." She shrugged. "It's weird. I thought boys were supposed to get handsome as they got older. Him, though? First word that comes to mind to describe him is 'pretty.' It's confusing, honestly."

"Still crushing on the Boy-Who-Lived, Gin?"

"And the boy who saved my life two years ago," Ginny retorted. "You should've seen him, Hermione, with that sword in his hands and that giant snake dead behind him. It was like something out of one of those *Harry Potter* storybooks, only better!"

"I *have* seen him, remember? He saved me from that troll in first year, and he even ran off over a hundred dementors with a single *Patronus* just a few months ago." Hermione sighed. "You know Harry doesn't think he's anything special. He *hates* how famous he is, and how much of a fuss everyone makes over the Boy-Who-Lived stuff. Even if he *is* a hero in his own right."

"D'you think... maybe he's started to accept that finally, and that's why he's changing?"

Hermione snorted. "That or puberty. Honestly, my money's on the latter."

Ginny sighed.

"You really need to let that crush go, Ginny. Has he shown any sign at all that it's requited?"

"No, I don't suppose he has," Ginny said sadly. "He treats me like I'm his little sister. As if I need yet another big brother!"

"He's always wanted siblings. And anyway you could do worse for a brother than Harry."

Ginny scoffed. "I have! You've met Percy! The git has barely said two words to any of us that wasn't yelling at us to be quiet since he started at the Ministry."

"Still," she continued after a moment, "the ways he's changed remind me of a friend of mine." She sighed. "If Harry *does* turn out to be a girl, like her, I don't suppose it would change my chances one way or another. Pretty sure even *Charlie* has a better shot than me at this point. But it *does* have me thinking. *Do* I like girls? I suppose even thinking about it means I probably do, at least a little bit."

Hermione hummed noncommittally.

"What about you, Hermione?" Ginny continued.

"What *about* me?" Hermione retorted.

"Do *you* like girls?"

"Why Miss Weasley, are you coming on to me?" Hermione teased.

Ginny blushed. "Um. Are you? No, I mean..." She shook her head. "Answer the question."

Hermione thought for a while. "Well... I've certainly never found any *wizards* all that attractive."

"Oh really?" Ginny said. "What about Lockhart? I recall you being quite starry-eyed at Flourish & Blotts that year. And what about those hearts in your planner?"

"That ponce?" Hermione scoffed. "He wrote the books. I always get a little bit star-struck when I get to meet an author. There was certainly no *attraction* there." She shuddered. "And blame Lavender for those blasted hearts. Girl had _no_ sense of boundaries back then. She's still a bit hazy on the subject, truthfully."

"Alright, alright," Ginny said. "Then what about girls?"

"What about them?"

"Hermione, you know what I mean! Stop trying to wriggle out of it!" Ginny stuck her tongue out.

Hermione stuck hers out right back, surprising the younger girl.

"You've changed too, Hermione," Ginny said softly.

"In a good way, I hope?" Hermione asked, hesitantly.

"Yeah." Ginny said, smiling softly. "You've loosened up. Even if you *are* still a swot."

Hermione huffed. "Oh, *I'm* a swot? D'you know what Harry wants to do after Hogwarts?"

"Play quidditch for England?" Ginny asked.

Hermione snorted. "Enchanting. He wants to be an enchanter. Or 'artificer,' as he calls it. Apparently the two are different somehow."

"But don't you need Runes and Arithmancy for that?" Ginny asked, surprise colouring her tone.

"He got Professor McGonagall to let him drop Divination and test into them instead."

"Wow, wonder what brought *that* on," Ginny mused.

"His grandmother's journals, probably," Hermione answered. "She was apparently quite good at it. Had some novel ideas about modular rune schema."

"Okay, so you're a swot and he's a boffin," Ginny hummed. "You're still dodging the question, you prat! Do you or do you not play for the Harpies?"

Hermione laughed in shock at Ginny's euphemism, then huffed. "Fine. Sure. 'Sweet mother, I cannot weave -- slender Aphrodite has overcome me with longing for a girl.' Is that a problem?"

"Why would it be?" Ginny asked, confused.

"It's controversial in the muggle world," Hermione said. "I wasn't sure how the magical world felt about sexuality and gender identity and all that."

"Nobody cares, as long as the bloodlines are continued," Ginny responded, "and there's rituals and such for any families that can't or won't have a child the usual way."

"Huh," Hermione said.
