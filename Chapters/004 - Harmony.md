## Chapter 4: Harmony

### #4 Privet Drive, Surrey	1994/06/27	6:30

The next morning, after the usual morning ablutions and a quick breakfast of porridge, fresh fruit, and a nutrient potion, Elysia sat in the training room to meditate. After the initial grounding, centering, and contemplation of emptiness, she decided to pop into her mindscape.

"Hello!" Janet greeted her, as soon as she opened her eyes. She'd appeared back in the study. "Great work yesterday! Good use of resources, too. The bond with Dobby -- well, Robbie now, which is a very good thing -- anyway, *that* was unexpected."

Elysia raised an eyebrow. "Oh? What do you mean?"

Janet assumed a preparing-to-give-a-lecture pose. "If you recall, there is a formal oath to bind a house elf. You can think of this as the Bond of Agency, for reference. It makes the elf an agent of the House, so that it may act in service to the House. It does not make the elf a *member* of the House. When you added in the line about being part of the family, the nature of the bond changed. Instead of a Bond of Agency, it became a Bond of Brotherhood. While you both now act in the interests of House Potter -- especially as the last two members of House Potter -- there is no subservience. This is a bond of equals. As far as the bond is concerned, you two are siblings now. And thanks to the bond, you two will begin to instinctively act as siblings towards each other."

Elysia's eyes widened at that. "Woah! I have a brother!? This is so cool! I've always wanted a proper family..."

Janet smiled. "More than that, Ellie. The bond now acts more like a twin bond than a house-elf bond."

"Like the Weasley Twins?"

Janet nodded. "Just like that. A bit stronger, actually, thanks to how house-elf magic works. You can already share your subconscious knowledge library. You'll eventually be able to communicate telepathically, with enough practice, even without linking mindscapes."

"Wait, I can link mindscapes?"

Janet looked confused for a moment. "Oh, right, we weren't expecting this to come up yet. You weren't supposed to have to worry about symmetrical bonds like this until bonding with your soul-mates."

Elysia shook her head. "Wait, soul-*mates?* As in, more than one?"

"That's right," Janet replied. "You have a few potential soul-mates that you are likely to meet in this phase of your life. It's not some mystical bond in and of itself; it just means that you're extremely compatible. You'll just *get* each other more easily. That said, that compatibility lends itself to certain kinds of magical bond-oaths. The most common is the magical Marriage Vows; most magical married couples can at least sense their partner's moods through this bond, although usually by the point that's even an option they've been able to read each other's body language well enough already."

"Okay, so are you saying that that's a lower end on the abilities of a bond like that?"

Janet smiled. "Exactly! Because of how in-sync you are, there's less interference over the bond connection. That makes it more efficient, and so you can do more with that connection. Linking mindscapes is one of the more complex possibilities, as is sharing magic."

"Robbie did that with me yesterday."

"Yes, and that's a pretty common manifestation of a twin bond too. It all comes down to harmonics and thaumic resonance, really, for *any* bond. The more in-tune the ends are with each other, the better the connection."

"Okay, that's sounding like it's not limited to two people." Elysia said.

"It's not," Janet agreed. "There have been triad bonds, pack bonds, and House bonds before, for example. Obviously, the more people in the bond, the harder it is to get everyone in tune with each other, and therefore the less capable the bond becomes. Practically speaking, four is usually the upper limit for anything truly useful, though larger groups are not unheard of."

"That makes sense," Elysia said. "So, to compare this to light, or a radio, this is more about the frequency than the power?"

"Bingo!" Janet exclaimed. "Power is more a function of your individual *internal* harmony. That's why magic is so heavily intent-based. The stronger your intent, the more *unified* you are in your intent, the more powerful your magic is. It all comes down to focus and willpower. You should add the books about this to your list."

Elysia nodded. "I should just read them right now, honestly."

"I'll leave you to it, then," Janet replied, and vanished.

Elysia opened the binder on the desk.

> To Do
>
> - [ ] Find and read the primers on Math, Signal Processing, Bonds, Blood Magic, Rituals, and Soul Magic
> - [ ] Find and read the primer on Apparition
> - [ ] Establish a training regimen (see Appendix A)
> - [ ] Check out The Kiln at Red Wharf Bay

After Elysia finished off the primers, she cracked open Appendix A. She found a comprehensive training plan, covering calisthenics, free-weights, cardio, flexibility, martial arts forms, combat shifting, and magical development. There were specific exercises to build magical stamina (by casting and holding a wandless *Patronus* charm -- or several, at more advanced stages -- for longer and longer intervals), control (by wandlessly levitating more and more tennis balls while going through martial arts forms), power (the classic shooting gallery, with more and more durable targets), and finesse (more and more detailed *Image*-class illusion charms and conjurations). Each day's workout ended with stretching and a meditation session. All told, she expected it to take anywhere from an hour to the entire day, depending on what point she was at in the training cycle and how much time she wanted to spend that day.

From yesterday's reading, she knew that, while she could use shifting to augment her physical abilities, only exercise would build the base level. The stronger she got *without* shifting, the more she'd be able to do *with.*

Popping back to the real world, she got on with it. Robbie joined her, and the two even sparred for a bit. This was complicated by the bond, as not only had the knowledge and instincts been shared, but so had the combo patterns. They found themselves throwing the same moves at the same time more often than not, and Elysia made a note for them both to work on that.

Finally, after they were done training, Elysia shifted back to Harry-form and headed out into Durzkaban to borrow the phone. She'd had the idea that her friends might want to come along to check out the Red Wharf property. There wasn't enough time to send Hedwig with a letter asking Ron, nor did she have access to a floo. Hermione, on the other hand, lived in a muggle house, and had a telephone. And she'd given Elysia her number (and address) after the debacle with the bars on the window and the flying car two summers ago.

Thankfully, Dudley was still at Smeltings until July, and Vernon was at work. Petunia was out in the garden gossiping with Mrs. Argyle in #6, though it was nearing noon so she'd have to be quick before her aunt came back in out of the heat.

"Granger residence," Hermione's voice said.

"Hey, Hermione," Elysia said.

"Harry! Somehow I never expected you to call. You always send Hedwig, and I suppose I've just gotten so used to the way witches and wizards do things, it's always such an adjustment being back from Hogwarts over the summers."

"Breathe, Hermione," Elysia laughed. Hermione made a little *hmph* noise as she continued. "Anyway, you doing anything today? I stopped by Gringotts yesterday to see if anything of my parents' was in storage -- after last year, I got curious about the Marauders and all that -- and it turns out there was!"

"Ooh! Like what, Harry?" Hermione asked.

"Like a lot of things," Elysia replied. "Like years' worth of journals for both of them, and the deed to some place in Wales from my grandfather. There's a portkey at Gringotts, and I was planning on taking it down this afternoon to look around. Interested in coming with? You can meet Robbie, too."

"Robbie? Who's Robbie? Harry, it's been all of a day!" Hermione said.

"If you come with, you can find out," Elysia teased.

"Okay, fine," Hermione huffed. "What time?"

"Noon or so? We can grab lunch in Charing or something, make an afternoon of it."

"Harry, it's almost noon now! How're you going to get here so quickly?"

"You'll find out. See you in a bit, Hermione."

Ending the call, Elysia made it back to her room just as she heard Aunt Petunia coming in through the back door.

### Granger House, Crawley	1994/06/27	12:01

Robbie popped the two of them to Hermione's doorstep. Elysia wasn't sure how Robbie knew where it was -- she hadn't even seen him check a map. And yet here they were.

Robbie had shifted into his human form again, and Elysia was back in the androgynous look she'd left Gringotts in yesterday. They were both dressed in the same outfits as yesterday -- jeans, t-shirts, and the dragonhide boots and jackets (Robbie had laid claim to the Hebridean Black, while Elysia preferred the Ukrainian Ironbelly). Elysia wore a plain heather-grey v-neck, but Robbie's t-shirt said "Frankie Says Relax" in big letters across the chest.

The door burst open at Elysia's knock. "Harry!" Hermione flew at her, engulfing her in a classic Hermione-hug. It struck Elysia then just how off-kilter she always felt over the summer, because all of a sudden, *she didn't.*

Hermione disengaged the hug and held Elysia at arm's length. "Harry," she said, "what happened? You look *fantastic!* It's only been a day! How have you changed so much in only a day? And who is this?" She asked, turning to Robbie.

Elysia smiled. "Hullo, 'Mione. This is Robbie. My brother."

Hermione gasped. "Your _what?_ Harry, I thought all your family were dead! Aside from those dreadful Dursleys, of course."

"It's a long story," Elysia said. "What say I fill you in over lunch? Robbie and I found this little sushi joint 'round the corner from the Leaky."



-----



"So because you changed the words of the bond oath, you and Robbie have a twin bond now?" Hermione asked, nibbling on a piece of pickled ginger.

"Pretty much," Elysia said. She and Robbie had filled Hermione in over several rolls of sushi. It was a good thing Robbie had put privacy and notice-me-not palings on their table after their food arrived, because Hermione simply could not contain herself. Her eyes got bigger and bigger as Elysia went on, and at several points she couldn't help but exclaim out loud.

"And you have memory-constructs of your parents in your mindscape?" She went on. 

Elysia nodded.

"And a library in your head full of *more knowledge than Hogwarts!?*" Hermione exclaimed. 

Elysia nodded again.

"And on top of that you're set for life, money-wise," Hermione continued. "Are there any *other* Earth-shattering revelations you need to tell me?"

Elysia took a deep breath. "Just one more. Hermione, I'm a girl."

Hermione's brow furrowed. "What? Harry, what do you mean?"

"It's Elysia now, or Ellie for short, not Harry. At least, not when I don't have to be." She shifted into girl-form, letting her hair lengthen but keeping it her usual black. She swept her glasses off and leaned intently across the table towards Hermione. "You're the *only* person who knows so far, besides Robbie. I haven't even told Ron yet."

"Merlin," Hermione stammered. *Wow she's pretty,* she caught herself thinking.

Elysia shifted back, replacing her glasses. "Hermione? Please say something?" She said hesitantly.

"I... wow. Somehow, it makes sense," Hermione said. "So, are you, what's the word... transgender?"

Elysia shrugged. "I guess? Is that the word for not knowing you're a girl at first?"

"Pretty much," Hermione said. "I bet being able to shapeshift like that helps a lot, huh?"

"Like you wouldn't believe."

### The Kiln, Red Wharf Bay, Wales, UK	1994/06/27	13:02

After activating the portkey at Gringotts, the three of them appeared in an unpaved lane across from a fenced plot of land. A branch of the lane led into the property, with an arched gate proclaiming this place to be 'The Kiln.' In the distance, they could see a building of some sort.

Elysia immediately shifted back to girl-shape, and Robbie back to elf-shape. "Ah, much better," they both said, then looked at each other and burst out laughing. 

Hermione just gave them a look, though Elysia noticed her lips twitching.

They eventually made it to the end of the drive, to find that there were actually several buildings. One was a barn, painted a weathered red. Another was what looked like a distillery, with various faucets and fittings sticking from the walls. A third was a nondescript wooden building that nevertheless fairly shone when Elysia looked at it under mage-sight (which she'd learned from yesterday's primers).

The final building was a cozy-looking one-story farmhouse. It too shone under mage-sight, though not as brightly as the other building. In fact, that building reminded Elysia of something...

"Hey, you lot, I think that building's like the trunk," Elysia said to the others.

"Ooh!" Hermione squealed, and darted over to it.

The other two joined her as she tugged open the door. Inside, visible through the daylight streaming in behind them, was a schema stone pedestal nearly identical to the one in Elysia's residential trunk.

Elysia cast a few wandless *lumos* orbs as Hermione dashed over to take a closer look. Robbie started examining the walls, and Elysia sent a few more orbs his way before joining Hermione.

"Thanks, Ellie," he murmured absently.

"Sure, bro," she replied, just as absently.

"Merlin's beard, you really weren't kidding about that bond," Hermione said.

"Huh?"

"Ellie, you just called Robbie 'bro.'"

"... I did? Huh. You OK with that, Robbie?" She called.

"Sure, Ellie. Hey, I think the schema stone overloaded," He replied.

Elysia squinted at the pedestal. "You know, I think you're right. There're blast marks on the pedestal, and some rock dust."

Robbie nodded. "There's bits of rock all over the floor, too, and some of these traces are burned out. A *lot* of them, actually."

"I wonder what happened?" Hermione murmured.

"Dunno," Elysia shrugged. "One of Grandpa Fleamont's experiments, I suppose. Or Grandma Euphemia's, more likely."

"Ellie," Hermione said, stifling a giggle, "your grandfather's name is *Fleamont?*"



-----



After that, the actual farmhouse was disconcertingly normal. The front door opened into a greatroom, with a spacious kitchen area on one side, a dining area with a heavily-scuffed round eight-seat table, a couple of beat-up leather sofas and a matching armchair, and a large, floo-size hearth. A hallway led to four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and the master suite. The whole place was very cozy, but also absolutely *covered* in decades' worth of dust. And aside from the table, sofas, and armchair, completely empty -- no beds, no dressers or wardrobes, not even a desk. No personal effects, either. They made a quick circuit through the place and darted back outside, sneezing the whole way.

Robbie and Elysia looked at each other once the sneezes stopped. 

"Aerial survey?" 

"Uh-huh."

Elysia turned to Hermione. "Wanna come along?"

"What do you mean?" Hermione asked nervously. "You're not going to make me ride a broom, are you?"

Elysia winked at her and shifted into a hippogriff. 



-----



Although she managed to keep from squeezing her eyes shut, Hermione maintained a death-grip on Elysia's neck regardless of the wandless sticking charm on her jeans as the girls and Robbie, also shifted to hippogriff, flew around the property.

Most of the land was sectioned off for crops, though the fields had obviously lain fallow for a long time. One corner of the property was woodland, bordered on one side by a crystal-clear pond. In the middle of the property, though, hidden behind the cottage, was a rusted and overgrown quidditch pitch and a ramshackle broom-shed.

"Ron would love this!" Hermione yelled over the rushing air.

Elysia could only chirp in agreement.

They landed back in front of the pedestal building.

"Don't tell Ron you got me to ride you," Hermione said, with a bashful grin. "His head might explode."

Elysia flushed deep red, gaping. "I. Um. I think *my* head might explode."

Robbie laughed so hard he fell over.
