## Chapter 2: Keep In Mind

### #4 Privet Drive, Surrey	1994/06/26	04:30

Harry woke with a start. 

Fading moonlight streamed through the window, making the sleeping Hedwig's feathers glow softly. 

Checking the time on the battered old alarm clock Dudley had thrown against the wall one morning because he hadn't wanted to get up for school, Harry saw that it was still a couple of hours before sunrise. Hogwarts had let out only yesterday, and normally he slept like the dead that first night back.

Wait, *'he?'* Why did that feel so much more uncomfortable than usual?

A sudden headache stabbed his brain all over, and he fell back to the mattress with a groan.

"Hi, I'm Janet!"

"Aagh!" Harry yelped, jolting upright. She looked around in a confused panic. *Wait, 'she?'*

She found herself sprawled on an almost unnaturally green lawn, with a rustic-looking cottage to one side and a lake-side cabana to the other. Standing over her was a pretty brunette with a clipboard.

Harry scrambled to her feet as the brunette -- Janet, presumably -- continued speaking. "Welcome to your mindscape, your own personal Elysium!"

"We -- we're in my mind?" Harry asked.

"Yup!" Janet chirped. "And I'm a personification of your subconscious. Walk with me, Harry." She started towards the cottage. "Long story short, you died. Again. We decided to give you an edge on your next life through -- since clearly you can't rely on the adults in your life to do anything but screw you over or get in the way, we decided to make you as self-sufficient as possible. And all this," she waved vaguely around at the cottage they'd just entered, "is part of that." She sat primly on one of the squashy sofas near the hearth and patted the seat next to her.

Harry sat. "So... why am I a girl here?"

"We're in *your* head, Harry. You tell me," Janet answered.

"... Oh. Huh. That explains a lot, I guess. So I'm dead?"

"No, not anymore, Harry," Janet replied. "You got sent back to get it right this time. You can't remember the past lives, though, because it would destroy the space-time continuum -- and make dating kind of creepy, besides -- so we sort of *cheated.* A little bit."

Harry raised an eyebrow.

"Okay, fine, _a lot._ It's all here," Janet continued. "You left yourself a to-do list and some pointers. Most of the training-specific stuff is tucked away in your subconscious, tied to specific triggers; we didn't want to overwhelm you. But there are a couple of things you need to know up front."

"Like that I'm a girl?" Harry asked.

"No, that one was going to bubble up around this time in your life regardless. Puberty, don'tcha know. But before, you were so intent on not standing out that you just repressed it for the rest of your life. Now, though, since thanks to your between-lives training you can do something about it, we tied this first mindscape entrance to that realization as a trigger to bring you here."

"Really?" Harry said. A cold prickling sensation washed over her scalp. "Wait, don't tell me. I'm a shape-shifter, right?"

Janet stood with a smile. "Pretty much! Come on, it's time to show you the study."

They went down the hallway to a huge room filled with books, expansive bay windows with cozy-looking reading nooks, a substantial desk, and a floor safe tucked away in a corner. A black leather binder was sitting on the desk. Janet gestured to it. "Here's The List!" Elysia could hear the capital letters. "It's full of useful foreknowledge, but you'll only be able to read the parts you can act on or already know about at any given time. Too much future knowledge can mess you up. Your last self said it wouldn't do to have you too far out of sync with your peers; after all, you're too isolated as it is."

Harry nodded and opened the binder.

"The primers contain the sum total of knowledge and training from your afterlife on that subject," Janet said. "You and your advisors decided the first order of business was a degree of independence, so everything on this first list is to make you more capable of fending for yourself without setting off the Trace or relying on the adults in your life who have proven less than helpful."

"Dobby, huh?" Harry said. "Why didn't I think of that?"

"You did," Janet smirked. "Anyway, as the personification of your subconscious, I can dig up anything in your mind you ask me to, unless there's a good reason not to. If that's the case, I'll tell you so."

"Thanks, Janet," Harry smiled.

Janet waved a hand, and a pile of books appeared next to one of the reading nooks. Harry spent the next little while flipping through them, realizing that far more knowledge was pouring into her mind than was written on the page. By the time she was finished with the first book, she understood why.

"Bloody hell!" Harry exclaimed. "What a rush!"

"Wait 'til you read the next set," Janet grinned.

Harry dove right in, with a fervor that would have put Hermione Granger to shame.

"Woah," Harry said when she finally came up for air. "I know kung fu."

Janet placed a steadying hand on Harry's shoulder. "Now, remember, you don't have the physical or magical development yet to take full advantage of all you've just learned. Go slowly at first."

Harry nodded, with a huge grin on her face. "That's what the training regimen is for, yeah?"

Janet nodded. "You'll want to take care of the Gringotts business first, so you and Dobby can get any equipment you'll need."

"Gotcha."

Harry dove back in.

"The sun's coming up, Harry," Janet said as Harry finished the last of the books. 

"What, barely? I've been here for hours!" Harry exclaimed. "Wait, I remember now. Time's different in a mind-scape, isn't it?"

"It is," Janet confirmed. "But that's all the books on that first list, so I'd say we timed things out rather well, wouldn't you?"

"You -- I -- we *timed* this? Merlin!"

"He helped."

"I.... sort of remember that?" Harry said hesitantly. "Like a dream, almost."

"You weren't allowed to keep most of your memories of the afterlife," Janet reminded her. "Some of them, yes, such as that needed to effectively use your training, and a few of the people you trained with. Merlin, Morgana, Bruce Lee, the Founders... you'll remember bits and pieces, especially if it becomes relevant, but the only clear memories you were allowed to keep were of your parents."

"My... my parents?" Harry stammered.

"Go look in the bedroom," Janet replied with a soft smile.

The bedroom, it turned out, was empty. The deck beyond the French doors, however, was not.

"Mum? Dad?" Harry choked out, rushing to the deck.

James and Lily Potter turned and engulfed their child in a crushing hug.

Eventually, Harry pulled herself together. "You... aren't really here, are you? You're just personifications of my afterlife memories of you?"

"Pretty much," James shrugged. "But there're a lot of those. Enough for us to *effectively* be here for you in Elysium, your mindscape, even if the real us can't be. Those versions of us are watching over you, though. You can be sure of that."

"We're so proud of you, honey!" Lily cried, squeezing Harry again. Harry squeezed back.

A trickle of memories crawled over Harry's scalp, helping to temper her emotions at seeing her parents again. *For the first time in this lifetime,* her memories whispered, *but not the last. They're right here!* She squeezed them one last time. "I guess it's time to get things moving," she said.

Her parents nodded, her dad with a devilish grin and her mum with a decidedly Slytherin smirk. "They won't know what hit them, Nemesis," Lily said.

James patted her on the back. "Go get 'em, kiddo!'"
