## Chapter 17: Turn Me Loose

### Deputy Headmistress' Office, Hogwarts, Scotland	1994/11/27 19:15

As much of a whirlwind as November had been, Elysia had hoped December would be a much-needed return to some semblance of normal, and give her the chance to catch her breath and take stock. The Hex Games, for all their flash and glamour, were a distraction from more important things, in the long term. Sirius was still a fugitive, Riddle still had horcruxes, and Dumbledore was still meddling. And beyond that, there were wrongs she could put to rights now, and just hadn't had a chance to yet: Remus' lycanthropy, for instance, and Nell's parents.

But on top of everything else, a new concern was dropped on her lap before December even arrived: the Yule Ball.

Unlike many of her classmates, her concern was not so much about asking the person (or _people,_ as the case may be) she liked. No, her problem was a bit trickier.

"What do you mean, 'only _one_ partner?" Elysia whined.

"I'm sorry, Miss Potter," Professor McGonagall said. She'd called Elysia into her office after dinner the Sunday after the Second Task. "It's in the tournament rules. The opening dance is a _paired_ waltz. The rest of the night you may do as you please, but not for this."

Elysia sighed, but then perked up as an idea came to her. "Well, then, milady McGonagall," she said, conjuring a bouquet[^4] of amethyst flower, butterfly orchis, _calla Ã¦thiopica,_ saffron crocus, reeds, and lyre-flower. "Mayhap you will grace my unworthy self with your illustrious company for the occasion, and we can show them how it's done." She presented the bouquet with a flourish, a wink, and a rakish, lop-sided grin.

Professor McGonagall laughed, blush staining her cheeks pink. "You charming rogue! Yes, alright, I'll open the Ball with you, you scoundrel." She conjured a vase for the flowers, placing the bouquet carefully within. "I'm sure Rolanda won't begrudge the one dance."

Elysia cocked an eyebrow. "You and Madame Hooch? That's perfect!"

McGonagall smiled warmly. "It is, rather," she agreed, a bit misty-eyed. "We've been friends forever -- were in Gryffindor together, in fact -- and when Elphinstone died, Rolanda and I, well..."

Elysia smiled. "I know what it's like to fall in love with your best friend. It's... special. And more than a little bit terrifying at times."

"Aye, that it is," McGonagall agreed with a wistful sigh. "And I'll let you in on a little secret: Rolanda is an animagus too. A great horned owl."

Elysia giggled. "How poetic!"



[^4]: Using [this](https://files.magic-spells-and-potions.com/files/flower-language-dictionary.htm) flower-language dictionary, the bouquet means, in rough measure, admiration, flattery, and playfulness regarding the dance.

Rita's opening salvo appeared in the Sunday Prophet the week after the Second Task. It spilled the beans about there never being a trial for Sirius, and mentioned evidence that absolutely _had_ to have been suppressed, because otherwise there would have never been any doubt as to Sirius' innocence. The article ignited a wildfire of public outcry, that a Lord of a Most Ancient and Noble House could be so... _betrayed_ by the very system the Houses claimed as birthright. 

_Ironic,_ Elysia thought. _Still, it's nice to have the sheep stampeding against someone else for once._

A proper trial was scheduled for the end of the week. She and the others met every evening with Rita and Solicitor Bulstrode, who was building Sirius' case for Barrister Eberhardt, to prepare evidence and testimony. Elysia, Hermione, and Sirius had given memories, as well -- even Professor Snape had consented to provide his testimony and memories of the night Pettigrew had escaped last summer.

By some small miracle, they'd managed to keep the trial off of Dumbledore's radar. Solicitor Bulstrode said that because of evidence of Dumbledore's involvement in the whole sordid affair, Barrister Eberhardt had been able to convince Amelia Bones, the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, to have Dumbledore recused from presiding over the trial due to conflict of interest. This meant that Augusta Longbottom, Nell's gran, would be presiding in his place.

"We'll have to cure your parents right quick then, Nell," Elysia said. "From what I've been told, it was Dumbledore who sold them out to the Death Eaters -- indirectly, of course, but there should be enough of a trail."

"Gran will be _furious_ when that comes out," Nell agreed. "Hell, _I'm_ furious."

"Me too," Elysia said. "Did you know that your mum is my godmother? If things had gone differently, we'd've grown up together, Nell."

"I've always wanted a little sister!" Nell smirked as Elysia put on an affronted face before giggling.

### Janus Thickey Ward, St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies, London, UK	1994/12/07	03:15

That night, Tuesday night -- Wednesday morning, really, well after Astronomy had ended -- Nell and Elysia shadow-walked into St. Mungo's under Elysia's invisibility cloak.

_You really think it'll be that simple?_ Nell sent hopefully.

_Conceptually, anyway,_ Elysia replied. _Obliviating that much psychological trauma after so long, though..._

_Yeah. Well, I suppose we'll find out in a bit, huh?_

_That we will. I'm glad Luna and 'Mione have such good control. Don't think I could do it myself._

They reached the end of the ward, where Frank and Alice Longbottom's private room was. Elysia flipped her glasses to active mode, seeing nothing of note, and they shadow-walked to the other side of the door.

_Monitoring charms on the beds,_ Elysia sent, _but nothing on them. You've got the spuds?_

_Here. I still think it's weird that they'll show as actual brains, even if they are comatose._

Elysia shrugged in response. _You and me both._

Nell pulled out a pair of potatoes and set them on the ground between the beds. Elysia gestured, transfiguring them into replicas of Nell's parents, then shifted one finger into a needle-like probe with a tiny eye, which she inserted into first one, then the other replica's ear. Using the probe, she carved runes of minor permanency into the ear canal behind the eardrum, where they would be almost impossible to notice unless one knew where to look. This way the transfigurations would hold until dispelled instead of fading over time.

_Merlin, that's unnerving,_ Nell shuddered.

_It's not any better on this end either,_ Elysia agreed.

They both cast wandless switching spells, trading the Longbottoms for their starchy doppelgangers. Some quick sleep and featherweight charms, and they each picked up a patient and shadow-walked to The Kiln.



-----



Luna and Hermione were waiting for them when they arrived. They'd prepared the ritual room, and now they placed Nell's parents side by side in the center.

"Is everything ready?" Elysia asked. 

Hermione nodded. "Should be. I'll take Alice, and Luna will take Frank."

She lay down with her head towards the inside of the circle, on Alice's side. Luna copied her on Frank's side, and Nell lay down with her head towards her parents' heads. Elysia matched her at their feet. Sirius and Remus stood watch.

The four girls held hands and began chanting.

"_Animabus et mentibus intrare quod restituo. Et vectigal quidem damnis mederi vulneribus._"

As they chanted, a glow began to fill the circle. They closed their eyes, and when they opened them again, they found themselves in a white room with black curtains. On one wall, two doors stood closed. One was labeled 'Frank' and the other 'Alice'.

Elysia gestured, conjuring an orb of light. Two tendrils of magic sprang from it, one latching onto Hermione and the other Luna. A display flashed into place over the orb.

"Anchor and tethers are nominal," Elysia said, giving the screen a once-over.

Another set of tethers latched onto Elysia and Nell. "Power feed is green. Resonance feed is green. We are go." Luna and Hermione saluted, and stepped through their respective doors. "Good luck!"



-----



Luna stepped into the heart of a maelstrom.



-----



Hermione stepped into a dark, tangled forest, choked with poisonous-looking weeds.



-----



"Contact. It's... going to take awhile."



-----



After what seemed like days, with both Luna and Hermione drawing heavily on both Elysia and Nell, the maelstrom was quieted and the floodwaters retreated. The weeds were burned away and the forest bloomed with life.

Hermione and Luna returned through the doors, looking haggard.

"It's done," Hermione said.

Luna nodded, grabbing Hermione's hand like a lifeline.

"Damage report?" Elysia said, not without sympathy.

"Minimal," Luna replied.

"Ditto," Hermione agreed.

"Excellent," Elysia smiled tiredly. "Let's get out of here and get some rest."

### The Kiln, Red Wharf Bay, Wales, UK	1994/12/07	06:35

When the kids returned to school, Sirius and Remus awoke to stand watch over Frank and Alice.

"Just think, Moony, in a couple of days I'll be a free man! Legally!"

Remus snorted. "As if legalities mattered to you," he said fondly.

"Still, though!" Sirius said. He sighed, flopping on the sofa with his head in Remus' lap. "Merlin, what even is my life?"

"One hell of a ride," Remus said, running his fingers through Sirius' hair. "Can you imagine how Frank and Alice will feel when they wake up?"

"Thirteen years of hell? Yeah, I can," Sirius said, squeezing his eyes closed for a moment. "It's not going to feel real. It won't for awhile. Hell, it _still_ doesn't for me."

"Thirteen years of purgatory for me, but yeah. It's like a waking dream, being here with you, like this. Not to mention all the _other_ madness Elysia's brought with her this year. Seeing Lily and James again..."

"Yeah."

They sat quietly, enjoying the closeness and the quiet as the sun rose.



-----



Alice woke first.

"Ow, my head... Neville!" She sat up quickly, flinging away an unfamiliar blanket. Looking frantically around, she noticed another bed across the small room, and a familiar head of hair upon the pillow. "Frank! Where's Neville?"

"Huh? Owwww..." he woke with a start, sitting up and cradling his head in his hands.

Sirius and Remus, alerted by monitoring charms, bustled in just then -- Sirius with a tea tray, Remus with several potion vials. They'd debated sending only a de-aged Sirius in first, to ease the transition, but in the end decided that would only confuse things.

"Good morning, sleepy-heads!" Sirius chirped. "Welcome back to the world of the living!"

"Sirius? Remus?" Alice stared. "Why do you look so... so _old?_"

Frank looked up at that. "Alice? Why do _you_ look so old?"

"Thirteen years in hell will do that," Sirius said. "Your kid's fine, by the way. Expect a visit after dinner this evening."

Alice wilted with relief.

"Wait, what do you mean _thirteen years!?_" Frank exclaimed.

"That's a long story that we've set aside the day to tell," Remus answered. "But first, we need to make sure you're up for it. Restoratives first, then we'll talk over tea."

He passed the potions out. Frank downed his immediately, smiling as the life returned to his atrophied body. "Come on, love, shake the dust off," he teased Alice.

She huffed, but assented and downed her own potions. "Oh wow, that's much better!" She exclaimed after polishing them off. "Merlin, how bad was it?"

"Pretty bad," Sirius answered. "I wasn't exaggerating when I called it hell. Best have some tea first." He poured a bracing cuppa for all four of them, setting the tray of nibbles to hover between the beds. Remus conjured chairs for himself and Sirius.

"Alright," Sirius started, once everyone was settled. "What's the last thing you remember?"

"I remember the wards fell, and those horrible Lestranges burst in -- and the Crouch boy! Barty Jr." Alice replied.

"I remember lots of _Cruciatus_ curses, but not the pain," Frank added.

"Looks like it worked, then," Remus said, shooting a look at Sirius.

"They're amazing, aren't they?" Sirius grinned. "You're next, you know."

Remus' eyes widened. "They can _do_ that?"

"Hey!" Alice cut in. "Can _someone_ explain just what is going on, already?"

Sirius and Remus shared a sheepish look. "Right, sorry," Remus said. "Long story short, 13 years and... a month ago, give or take -- the Lestranges and Barty, Jr. tortured you two into oblivion. You've been in the Janus Thickey ward at St. Mungo's ever since, until last night." He sighed. "And now the story gets... complicated."

Sirius patted him on the leg. "Now it gets _good,_ Moony."

"Well... that's debatable." Remus retorted. "Most of the '80s were pretty much purgatory for all of us."

"Point," Sirius acknowledged. "It was really only four years ago when things got... _complicated._" He waggled his eyebrows at Remus, who snorted and punched him lightly on the bicep.

"Neither of us were in the picture until last year, Padfoot."

"Yeah, yeah." Sirius rolled his eyes. "It all comes down to Ellie, though, doesn't it? And that's when it all started for her." He looked back to the Longbottoms. "First things first. Neville is Nell now, and Lily & James' kid Harry is Elysia. They're both in Gryffindor, and doing rather well for themselves in spite of everything."

Remus took up the thread. "They're also the ones who got you out of St. Mungo's. And along with Ellie's girlfriends, Hermione Granger and Luna Lovegood, healed you. That lot are a force to be reckoned with."

"Them and Ginny Weasley, Arthur & Molly's youngest," Sirius added. "Those girls are _scary_ sometimes. And we'd know; they've been training us. I think all of them can dual-cast lightning bolts and the Singularity Shield now."

Frank and Alice looked at each other, then back to Sirius and Remus, eyes wide with shock.

-----

Catching the Longbottoms up on the past 13 years took the rest of the day. They were still rather shaken by it all when the girls all piled out of what they'd assumed was a linen closet that evening.

"Coming out of the closet? Really?" Alice asked sardonically.

"Mum!" Nell perked up at her voice, and dashed over to where the elder Longbottoms lounged in the greatroom with Remus and Sirius. The others were close behind.

The elder Longbottoms stood and engulfed both Nell and Elysia in a group hug before stepping back and giving the girls a once-over.

"You look just like your mother when she was your age, Nell," Frank said.

"But with Frank's eyes," Alice agreed.

Nell snorted. "That's exactly the reverse of what everyone used to say about you, Ellie!"

Alice raised an eyebrow. "Nah, she looks just like Lily, but with James' hair. Although yours is much less of a birds' nest, Ellie," she teased.

Elysia shifted her hair into her old boy-mode 'style'. "Like this?" She grinned impishly, before shifting it back.

Frank shook his head. "Yeah, definitely better than James' mop."

"So I guess Sirius and Remus filled you in?" Elysia asked.

"Broad strokes, but yes," Frank replied. "It was... enlightening."

"And infuriating," Alice growled. "He _swore_ the danger had passed! That our Secret-Keeper was safe! And the very next day, we're betrayed. We hadn't even dropped the _Fidelius_ yet!"

"Augustus Rookwood was a death eater," Remus said. "And yes, Albus knew. Severus had told him. You were sold out from the beginning."

Elysia's eyes flashed. "Albus Dumbledore has an awful lot to answer for."



### London, UK	1994/12/09 15:30

In the end, Sirius' trial didn't take long. Between his own testimony under veritaserum, the Gringotts-provided copy of the Potters' wills, and pensieve memories of the confrontation with Peter Pettigrew last June from Elysia, the verdict was a foregone conclusion. No, what really shook things up was the testimony from the Longbottoms, and what that testimony (and corroborating evidence) implied about Dumbledore: that he'd lied and covered up the truth for his own machinations, destroying families and leaving innocent people to over a decade in hell. More to the point, he single-handedly brought multiple Ancient and Noble Houses to the brink of destruction, which the Wizengamot, in their infinite self-interest, simply could not abide.

Dumbledore being, well, Dumbledore, Madam Bones and Madam Longbottom had managed to keep the newly-begun investigation into his illicit activities under wraps until they had an iron-clad case built against him. Eberhardt, Bulstrode, & Tonks were appointed as the prosecution, since they'd already been building a case.

That very day, before he could be remanded into the custody of St. Mungo's finest mind-healers, Sirius escaped to Gringotts with a laundry-list of critical tasks. First on the list, of course, was taking up the mantle of Lord Black, which was as simple as putting on the Head's ring. Its inherent link to the Black family magic did the rest.

Next, for his first act as Lord Black, he reinstated Andromeda Tonks and her daughter, Nymphadora, into the family. Second, of course, was dealing with Bellatrix.

Several things needed to happen in specific order, and Sirius made a point of not only dating the parchment-work, but time-stamping it. First he nullified her marriage to Rudolphus Lestrange, which caused forfeiture of her dowry. Since the Lestranges no longer had enough to pay it back in full, due to helping to finance the death eaters in the first war, their entire vault was confiscated by the goblins and turned over to Sirius. He then attempted to cast her out of the family, declaring her forsworn and a traitor to the House of Black.

This was the first big surprise.

Family magics are strange things. More of a _genius loci_ than anything, only tied to a bloodline rather than a place, over the generations they became semi-sentient. And while, normally, all a Head needed to do to cast someone out was to declare it so while communing with the Family Magic, in this particular case the Magic refused.

As it turned out, according to the Family Magic, Bellatrix had not been acting of her own free will since her betrothal to Lestrange, and with the suspicious death of Arcturus Black, the previous Head, just before, the Magic had been unable to do anything about it. Sirius made a note to deal with this later -- but quickly, because the Family Magic was panicking, had been the whole time, and it was starting to affect Sirius himself.

Regardless, his next task was to deal with a couple of the horcruxes. He made his way down to the former Lestrange vault, where he called Robbie in as back-up. They found that everything in the vault had been heavily cursed, such that touching anything would cause the interloper to be buried in super-heated copies of whatever was touched.

"Honestly, Trixie," Sirius muttered. "Are you a witch or not?" Mage-sight active, he and Robbie quickly found Hufflepuff's Cup and levitated it into a pre-prepared lead containment box Robbie had brought. Before the box was sealed, Sirius hit the Cup with _suntsitu arima lotua,_ the horcrux-killer spell Elysia had taught him.

The goblin by the cart burst in at the horcrux's death-wail. "What was that, wizard?"

"Just some curse-breaking," Sirius shrugged. "The vault's _former_ holders were mean little bastards." He smirked. "It's almost like they _expected_ to lose their vault. Still, rather short-sighted of them."

The goblin nodded. "We will, of course, be freezing all transactions for this vault until the curses are lifted."

Sirius grinned. "Of course. I'll take care of it."



### The Kiln, Red Wharf Bay, Wales, UK	1994/12/09 19:00

There was a bit of a party at The Kiln that night. Elysia's triad were there, as were Nell and Ginny, Nell's parents, Remus, and Sirius himself. The usual suspects, really.
