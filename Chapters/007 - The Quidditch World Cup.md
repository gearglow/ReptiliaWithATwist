## Chapter 7: The Quidditch World Cup

Morning came too soon even for Elysia, who was already in the habit of rising early. The sky was still dark when Mrs. Weasley shook everyone awake.

"It's time, dears," she said. "You've got a bit of a hike ahead of you."

Eventually all of the kids in the house were roused, readied, and rounded up.

"Why aren't Bill, Charlie, and Percy awake yet?" Ron asked petulantly.

"Well, they're of-age, aren't they?" Mrs. Weasley answered. "They're apparating later. You lot need to catch the portkey."

Ron grumbled incoherently under his breath.

Mrs. Weasley gave them each a hug and a bundle of egg sandwiches as she chivvied them out the door.

After hiking through the cold darkness of the pre-dawn morning, up a dew-slippery hillside for nearly an hour, they finally reached the top of Stoatshead Hill, where they encountered the Diggories. Amos, the father, had a bad habit of bragging about his son to the detriment of everyone else, especially Elysia. Cedric, the son, to his credit was thoroughly embarrassed about it, but Hermione locked eyes with Elysia and, over passive legilimency, sent: *doesn't he have just the most* punchable *face?*

It was all Elysia could do not to laugh out loud at that.

Eventually, everyone managed to arrange themselves so they could all reach the portkey, which turned out to be a mangy old boot. Elysia and Hermione bent their knees and, alone of the kids, managed to stay standing when they arrived at their destination.

"Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill," a voice said.

Mr. Weasley chatted with the two wizards who seemed to be coordinating portkey arrivals, getting directions to their campsite. After checking in with the muggle in charge of the site, who kept needing to be *obliviated* (according to one of the Ministry workers, anyway), they finally reached the field where all of the tents were.

Elysia could see why the muggles kept catching on. Most of the tents looked as if they'd at least *started* as normal, non-magical tents, but here and there someone had slipped up and added something absurd, such as a chimney or a weather vane. And there were a few which were so outrÃ© they could only be magical. There was one which looked straight from *Arabian Nights,* with striped silk awnings and several live peacocks tethered by the door. Another resembled nothing so much as a miniature castle, with three floors and honest-to-Merlin *turrets.* 

Eventually, they reached a plot next to a wooded area, with a sign planted in it saying 'WEEZLY.'

"Best spot in the place," Mr. Weasley said happily. "Stadium's just through the trees there. Now, strictly speaking, we shouldn't use magic while we're out on muggle land in these numbers. We'll have to put the tents up by hand!"

"Oh," Robbie said. "Oops?"

They all turned to find that Robbie had already set up the two tents they'd brought. Mr. Weasley looked a bit disappointed, but the relief on his children's faces was plain.

"Um, Mr. Weasley?" Hermione asked. "How're we going to fit so many people into only two tents?"

"Why don't you take a look inside?" Mr. Weasley said with a wink.

Elysia and Hermione entered one of the tents to find what appeared to be a three-bedroom flat, complete with kitchenette and bathroom.

"It's like my trunk, then," Elysia murmured to Hermione quietly.

"One day you're going to have to give me the tour," Hermione replied.

Mr. Weasley roped Elysia, Hermione, and Ron into going to collect water for tea, largely as an excuse for them to explore.

They ran across several classmates: fellow Gryffindor Seamus Finnegan, whose tent was covered in Shamrocks, sitting with his mum and his best friend, Dean Thomas; Oliver Wood, Gryffindor's former quidditch captain, who had just signed to Puddlemere United; Ernie Macmillan, who was a Hufflepuff in their year; and Cho Chang, a pretty girl who was the seeker for Ravenclaw's quidditch team. She waved to Elysia, who winked back flirtatiously, causing Cho to blush and Hermione to giggle.

"Bloody hell, mate, you're a dangerous one," Ron quipped. "Where'd *that* come from?"

Hermione smirked.

"It's easier when it doesn't matter, I guess," Elysia said.

"Doesn't *matter?*" Ron retorted, incredulously. "What, are you into blokes or something? That's *Cho Chang!* She's the prettiest girl in school!"

"To you, maybe," Elysia said. "And no, I'm definitely not into blokes. She's just not my type, I guess. Personality clash." She shrugged. "Besides, isn't she with Diggory?"

"Yeah, so? She's still gorgeous!" Ron said.

"Methinks the Weasley doth protest too much," Hermione snarked.

"I think you're right," Elysia smirked. "You sure you're not into blokes, Ron? Viktor Krum, maybe?"

Ron scowled.

"Maybe just Harry," Hermione laughed.

Elysia winked at Ron, grinning, and waggled her eyebrows. 

Ron flushed. "Prat!" He said, stomping off ahead of them.

Elysia rolled her eyes. "Boy takes himself way too seriously for someone related to Fred & George."

"Percy," Hermione retorted. "And to be fair," Hermione continued, biting her lip, "you *are* much too good at that look."

"It's not so hard," Elysia scoffed. "You try."

"I don't think that's really my style," Hermione replied.

Elysia studied her for a moment. "Fair enough. You're more the 'doe-eyed innocence with a hidden wicked streak' type, I think."

Hermione assumed a 'who, me?' face, but it failed miserably as her lip kept twitching. They both burst out laughing.



-----



They returned to find Mr. Weasley playing with matches, and the twins 'supervising.' Hermione took over, and, with a surreptitious wandless _incendio,_ eventually they had a fire going. Mr. Weasley kept up a running commentary on all the Ministry workers passing by as they waited for the fire to die down to cooking coals.

Bill, Charlie, and Percy walked up from the apparition point in the woods just as the coals were ready. They all sat around the fire cooking sausages on sticks (the sandwiches Mrs. Weasley'd sent them with having been devoured long since).

Ludo Bagman, the head of the Department of Games and Sports at the Ministry, dropped by and tried to get them to bet on the match. Mr. Weasley bet a galleon on Ireland to win. Fred and George almost bet their life savings on Ireland to win but Krum catching the snitch, until Elysia took them aside and mentioned that she'd heard rumors that Bagman liked to pay out his books with leprechaun gold, and the goblins weren't too happy about that. So they bet 10 galleons and a fake wand instead, and Elysia promised, if their business plan was good enough, when she reached her majority she'd invest enough in Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes for them to set up shop in style.

Then Bartemius Crouch, Percy's boss and the head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation, apparated in and dragged Bagman away, berating him over the Bulgarian delegation requesting twelve more seats in the Top Box. Bagman went, dropping hints about some big mystery event at Hogwarts this year.

Since their seats were also in the Top Box, Elysia decided she'd better pop into her mindscape and see if there were any language books, and leaned back in her seat with closed eyes.

> To Do
>
> - [x] Stop the Twins from betting and losing their life savings
> - [x] Find and read the primers on French, Bulgarian, Irish Gaelic, Scots Gaelic, Welsh, Russian, Latin, Greek, Indonesian, Mongolian, Nepali, Thai, Amharic, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Greek, Spanish, Aquitanian, Modern Euskara, Swiss, Swedish, Icelandic, Khmer, and German

As the afternoon wore on, the lanes between the tents began to fill with vendors, hawking souvenirs of all sorts. Ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat; an animated figurine of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian seeker; and a large green luminous rosette.

Elysia's attention was drawn to a cart full of brass binoculars covered in dials and knobs. The salesman called them 'omnioculars,' and explained all about the functions. Elysia decided to buy a set for everyone in their party. Ron tried to argue, but she insisted. "Consider it my way of paying your family back for getting me a seat in the Top Box."

They got back to their campsite, where Elysia handed around the omnioculars. They'd just gotten everything squared away when a gong boomed out through the campsite, and green and red lanterns lit a path through the woods.

"It's time!" Mr. Weasley exclaimed, leading them excitedly down the path.



### World Cup Stadium	1994/08/22	20:00

On the other side of the woods stood a *massive* stadium which seemed to be made of gold, or more likely brass. They climbed all the way up to the Top Box, which was situated exactly halfway between the goalposts on either end of the pitch. The box had an open area in the back, where they all entered, and four rows of ten seats each up front, overlooking the pitch.

They were almost the first to arrive, so they all filed into the front row. Robbie conjured a seat on the left end, with Hermione next, then Elysia, then Ron next to her. In the second row, behind Hermione, sat the only other occupant of the box -- another house elf, who was trying valiantly to ignore the exceedingly high view over the railing.

"Winky?" Robbie said, surprised.

"Dobby?" The other elf said. "But -- you is wearing clothes!"

"It's Robbie now," Robbie replied. "I'm a Potter elf." For Robbie was wearing the uniform he'd found in the storage vault, with the Potter crest displayed proudly upon the left breast. He was still wearing his dragonhide boots and jacket, though. "And Harry's brother," he added proudly.

Winky gasped. "Is this true, sir?" She asked, turning to Elysia. "Is Harry Potter taking in a trouble-maker like this one and giving him ideas above his station?"

"Robbie is family," Elysia said firmly. "We take care of each other. I don't think Robbie's a trouble-maker at all, or at least no more than I am."

Hermione snorted softly at that.

"And I'm sure I don't know what you mean by 'ideas above his station,'" Elysia continued. "Magic says he's my brother, and he behaves as a brother should."

"Brother!" Winky squeaked. "Begging yous pardon, but Harry Potter bes just as odd as Robbie."

"Why thank you," Elysia grinned.

Winky shuddered and went back to hiding from the heights.



-----



The box slowly filled over the next half hour. Mr. Weasley and Percy kept shaking hands with VIPs as they entered. Minister Fudge came in with the Bulgarian Minister, who seemed to not speak a word of English.

"Ah, Harry, my boy!" Fudge exclaimed by way of greeting.

"Good evening, Minister," Elysia replied. "No dementor bodyguard this time?" 

Fudge scowled. "Now see here --"

She cut Fudge off by turning to the Bulgarian minister, and greeted him in his native tongue. *"Good evening, sir. I'm sorry for your loss."*

*"What loss?"*

*"Why, the hours of your life you'll never get back from having to deal with the shameless exhibition of incompetence we Brits are unfortunate enough to call our Minister."*

The Bulgarian minister and his staff roared with laughter.

*"What's this about a dementor bodyguard?"* He asked.

*"He put dementors around Hogwarts all last year,"* Elysia said. *"Nearly killed me and many other children on several occasions. And all to catch a Lord of an Ancient and Noble House who'd never even had a trial. Bit of a habit with him, from what I've seen. Makes you wonder if the man can even tie his own shoes without nearly asphyxiating himself and throwing the cobbler in prison."*

The entire Bulgarian delegation turned to face Fudge with menacing glares.

"When did you learn Bulgarian?" Hermione hissed. "And what did you say?"

"Tell you later, 'Mione," Elysia whispered back.

"Ah, Fudge," Lucius Malfoy said as he swept in with his family. Elysia was doubly disappointed, both for the presence of the Malfoys and the interruption to the rising tension between Fudge and the Bulgarians.

Mr. Malfoy introduced his wife and son to the Minister. Draco caught sight of Elysia and blushed, but turned away with a scowl when she smirked at him.

Before tensions could ramp up again, Ludo Bagman waltzed in. "Everyone ready?" He exclaimed.

"Please, Ludo," Fudge said.

Once everyone had finished taking their seats, Mr. Bagman cast a *sonorus* on himself and introduced the Bulgarian mascots.

The mascots turned out to be a hundred veela, who began to dance enticingly. Elysia could feel the magic of their allure tickle the edge of her mind, but it couldn't get through her occlumency shields. Still, she found the display enjoyable. Then she noticed Hermione leaning forward far enough to be dangerous, and pulled her back.

"Down, girl. You're drooling a bit," she murmured into Hermione's ear. "Put your shields up and watch the others make fools of themselves."

Hermione's glazed look cleared up as she shook herself, and smiled gratefully at Elysia. Turning, the two of them watched as the Weasleys -- and both Draco and his mother, though Lucius Malfoy, Charlie, and Mr. Weasley all seemed more or less unaffected -- postured absurdly. Even Ginny had started to stand, when the music stopped and the veela took their places on the sidelines.

"*Ahem.* And now," Mr. Bagman said, his voice cracking at first, "the Irish National Team Mascots!"

Elysia, Hermione, and Robbie giggled to each other as everyone else seemed to shake themselves from their daze with some embarrassment.

The Irish mascots, a swarm of leprechauns, put on a spectacular display of aerial acrobatics, showering the crowd with gold coins in the process. Ron hurriedly gathered up all he could, until Hermione leaned over and told him that it would disappear in a few hours anyway.

And then the game began in earnest.

It was a brutal affair, with the quaffle moving so fast it was only due to the omnioculars that anyone could keep track of it. Viktor Krum managed to pull off a Wronski Feint against Aiden Lynch, the Irish seeker, causing him to crash into the ground at full speed, and the game only got dirtier from there. Ireland began to pull ahead, bludgers flew every which way, penalties mounted, the mascots began to fight, and finally, with the score 170 to 10 favoring Ireland, Krum managed to plow Lynch into the ground again and grab the snitch, ending the game at 170 to 160 before it could turn into a full-on rout. 

"Vell, ve fought bravely," the Bulgarian Minister said.

"You can speak English!?" Fudge said incredulously. "You've been letting me mime everything all day!"

The Bulgarian Minister shrugged. "It vos funny." 

Elysia caught his eye and burst out laughing.

> To Do

> - [x] Mess with Fudge

Everyone was too keyed up to sleep when they finally made it back to camp, so they all sat around the campfire with mugs of hot cocoa.

"Harry," Hermione said, "what did you say to the Bulgarian Minister? And since when do you speak Bulgarian, anyway?"

"The 'how' is that my grandparents invented something called 'Language Lozenges[^1],'" Elysia answered, lying through her teeth. "Don't think they ever got the chance to market them; Granddad's journal mentions them right near the end, just before they caught the dragon pox that killed them."

"So, what, you found a stash of prototypes or something?" Hermione asked.

"Yup!" Elysia said. "Russian, both Irish and Scots Gaelic, Bulgarian, Polish, Hebrew, French, Spanish... all kinds, really. It's brilliant. Pity he didn't write down the formula."

Hermione nodded.

"Anyway," Elysia continued, "I took a few before I left the Dursleys. Figure, the Cup is an international event, right? Might be nice to understand some of the more international discussions."

"You're mental, mate," Ron said.

Elysia smirked. "No, 'mental' is what I said to the Bulgarian Minister." She relayed what she'd said.

"Harry James Potter! You did *not* just instigate an international incident!" Hermione admonished, laughing.

"Hey, Fudge is the dementor-happy one!" Elysia retorted. "I was just telling it like it is!"

"You have no proof of Sirius Black's innocence, Harry," Percy said stiffly.

"Proof?" Elysia retorted. "My own experiences last year aside, which I will swear to, or testify on under veritaserum? It's right there in black-and-white in my parents' wills. Which were sealed on Dumbledore's orders, by the way. And guess who cast the *fidelius* in the first place?"

Mr. Weasley looked uncomfortable. "I'm sure he had his reasons."

Elysia scoffed. "I'm sure he did. But that doesn't change the facts. Not like I can do anything about it anyway. So how about that Wronski Feint?"

The conversation, though stilted at first, slowly grew more spirited again as they recounted the match. Until, that is, Ginny started snoring. Mr. Weasley finally sent them all to bed.

Elysia, however, remembered Janet's warning, and began carving border stones for an anti-apparition ward. When the screams started and Mr. Weasley came in to tell them all to run, she told Robbie to lay the stones around the Death Eaters, then dutifully woke everyone.

Casting a wandless illusion-construct of herself running with her friends into the woods, she shifted into a gorgon and apparated in front of the Death Eaters, just outside her anti-apparition ward. In the ensuing panic, she managed to catch fully half of them in her petrifying gaze before the rest tried to apparate. When that failed, she caught another quarter of the remainder. By then ministry workers were starting to arrive, so she apparated back to the tents, shifted back to Harry-shape, and popped to where her illusion-self was. All in all it took maybe five minutes.

> To Do

> - [x] Neutralize the rioting Death Eaters

"Harry? You okay?" Hermione called at the loud crack that sounded as Elysia joined them.

"Stepped on a branch," Elysia replied, thankful it was so dark in the woods. She'd not been missed.

"Oh, this is stupid," Hermione said, pulling out her wand. "*Lumos.*"

A beam of light shone from the tip, illuminating Draco Malfoy leaning casually against a tree.

"Careful, Granger," he taunted. "Wouldn't want to call attention to yourself with that lot. They're hunting muggles, you know."

"Hermione's a witch!" Ron growled.

"And anyway, I don't think they're hunting much of anything anymore. D'you hear any screams? Or spellfire?" Elysia taunted. "Might want to go check on daddy dearest." She made her eyes flash green with a surreptitious wandless illusion, grinning maliciously at Malfoy's flinch.

Before things could escalate, they heard a hoarse shout from deeper in the woods. "*Morsmordre!*"



-----



Later, Mr. Weasley told them that they'd found Winky the house-elf with Ron's wand, and that, while the wand showed the Dark Mark spell when checked, nobody honestly believed that either Ron (who had witnesses as to his whereabouts the whole time) nor Winky had actually cast it. Winky, who turned out to be Bartemius Crouch's elf, had been summarily given clothes and dismissed.

"It was a sorry sight," he lamented. "Poor thing was sobbing her heart out."

Eventually everything settled down enough that they could return to the tents and get some sleep. Even Elysia managed, despite the shakes from an absolutely brutal adrenaline crash. It was still an early morning, though, as Mr. Weasley woke them before sunrise to catch the return portkey back to Stoatshead Hill.

A distraught Mrs. Weasley greeted them on their return, waving the morning edition of the Daily Prophet. The headline blared: "DARK MARK OVER WORLD CUP! DEATH EATERS PETRIFIED UNDER MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES!"

"Arthur!" She called out as they approached. "Is everyone okay?"

"Fine, Molly," he replied. "It was the strangest thing. By the time we got to the Death Eaters, they were almost all petrified. Oh, there were a few left, but none of them even tried to disapparate. We managed to catch every single one, aside from whoever conjured that Dark Mark."

*Did you manage to clear out the anti-apparition stones before the clean-up crew got there?* Elysia asked Robbie over their bond.

*Yup!* He answered proudly.

*Awesome! Thanks, bro!*

"What're you grinning about?" Ron asked suspiciously.

"Mr. Weasley," Elysia asked, with a pointed look at Ron. "Was one of those caught a certain Lucius Malfoy, by any chance?"

A look of understanding dawned on Ron's face.

"Well," Mr. Weasley replied, "can't say for sure. Ongoing investigation and all, y'see, and none of them have been un-petrified yet. But I wouldn't be surprised," he said with malicious glee. "Rumor has it that the Malfoys had broken camp sometime in the night, and aren't reachable this morning."

Everyone in earshot smirked at that, even Mrs. Weasley. There was no love lost between the two families.

The moment was broken when Elysia let out an enormous yawn, and Mrs. Weasley sent them all up to bed. Elysia realized she'd not had a proper night's sleep in two days, and was out as soon as her head hit the pillow.
