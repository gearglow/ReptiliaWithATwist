## Chapter 13: Send Lawyers, Guns, and Money

### Hogwarts	1994/10/30 16:00

At dinner on the last Saturday of October, Professor Dumbledore made the announcement that tomorrow afternoon, the 30th, the delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang would be arriving in time for dinner. The school had been scrubbed from top to bottom by the house-elves, until one could practically eat off the floors. 

The next day at 16:00, all of the students were made to stand in rows, in full uniform, on the castle's front steps. Elysia was standing with Hermione and Luna, holding hands and chatting over contact legilimency. Their conversation was interrupted as several students pointed overhead.

"Look! Up in the sky!" Lavender yelled. 

"It's a bird!" Parvati shouted.

"It's a plane!" Colin Creevey called. 

"It's Beauxbatons!" Lee Jordan announced. 

The girls looked at each other, hummed the first few bars of the _Superman_ theme, and cracked up.

As it turned out, the Beauxbatons delegation arrived in a truly _massive_ carriage pulled by winged horses the size of elephants. It landed gracefully on the lawn, whereupon a boy jumped out and placed a set of stairs against the doors. And out stepped the largest woman any of them had ever seen.

"Ah, Dumbledore," she rumbled in a smoky, sultry voice. She floated forward as gracefully as a dancer, despite her imposing stature.

"Madame Maxime," Dumbledore greeted with a warm smile. "How lovely to see you again! I trust your journey went smoothly?"

As they spoke, students had begun piling out of the carriage. They wore sky-blue uniforms of what looked like silk, and were obviously caught off-guard by the cold of autumn in Scotland, even one as mild as this year's had proven.

Hermione rolled her eyes at that. _Are you mages or not? Cast a warming charm!_ The other two snorted.

The Beauxbatons students all filed into the castle, following their headmistress. As they passed, something tickled at the girls' occlumency shields.

_Was that veela allure?_ Hermione asked.

_I think so,_ Elysia replied. _Hmm. I'm getting an idea..._

_You're not thinking of trying to out-allure the veela, are you?_ Luna asked, concern and amusement coloring her thoughts. _Because I don't think the school could take it._

_Well,_ now _I'm thinking about that,_ Elysia retorted. _But no, I was thinking, 'why limit aura broadcasting to just allure?'_

The other two considered that for a moment. _Elysia, love?_ Hermione said. _You're mad. Brilliant, but mad._

_We should broadcast 'silly' at dinner sometime!_ Luna giggled.

The other two cackled.

A few minutes later the Durmstrang delegation arrived, on a derelict galleon rising from the depths of the lake on a whirlpool. As the ship docked, a gangplank was lowered by hands unseen, and the students marched down, led by their headmaster. He had a goatee, close-cropped black hair with silver streaks, and an oily demeanor. Like his students, he was draped in heavy furs.

"Headmaster Dumbledore!" He cried jovially, clasping hands with him.

"Headmaster Karkaroff," Dumbledore said. "It's been quite some time."

"It has, at that," Karkaroff replied. "Would you mind terribly," he continued, "if we entered directly? Viktor here has a bit of a head-cold."

"Sweet Merlin, it's Viktor Krum!" Ron gasped, beginning to hyperventilate.

_Ronald Weasley, bi disaster,_ Elysia snarked.

_Right?_ Hermione responded.

Ginny reached over and smacked her brother. "Breathe, Ron," she murmured. "Before you make an even bigger fool of yourself."

The next morning, Janet called Elysia into the study.

"Just a heads-up," she warned. "Your name is going to come out of that goblet tonight as the fourth champion. I'd send off to a good solicitor first thing if I were you. Might I recommend Eberhardt, Bulstrode, & Tonks?"

"Good idea," Elysia replied. "I'll see if Robbie can drop by this morning."

Elysia pulled Hermione and Luna in, and they began to prepare for battle.

> To Do:
>
> - [x] Get a solicitor on retainer
> - [x] Find and read Battle Magic For The Baddest Bitches
> - [x] Find and read Magica Obscura: Shadow Magic, Bio-Alchemy, And Other 'Dark' Arts The Ministry Doesn't Want You To Know
> - [x] Find and read Curse-Breaking For Fun and Profit
> - [x] Find and read Elysia's Combat Style: Stage 4

"We've got some rituals to plan for," Elysia said. "I want to do an Imbuement ritual for the Unlimited Flight spell, and the Morphogenesis ritual, at least, and then transfer the shapeshifter knowledge. I want Nell in on this, too; it'll make her life a lot easier if she can go back in the closet when her gran's around for now.

"I think Ginny should be in on them too," Luna said.

"Agreed," Hermione said.

"Alright," Elysia said. "We'll check with them and see when we can do this. The sooner the better. I have a feeling the dragon dung's about to hit the blasting curse."



-----



Training that morning was intense, as all four of them -- the triad, plus Robbie -- pushed themselves harder than they ever had before. It got so intense, in fact, that the thaumic bleed-off warning alarm sounded.

"That's not something I ever expected to happen," Elysia said. "Now what?"

"No more conjuring black holes in the house?" Hermione said. 

Luna snorted. "Bet you never thought you'd say _that,_ love."

"Too right," Hermione giggled.

"I think," Robbie mused, "that I can repair the room at the Kiln, and replace this training room with a gate to there. It's got more _lignum vitae_ to work with, and I can install some grounding stones along the foundation too."

"That's brilliant, Robbie!" Hermione said.

"It is," Elysia agreed. "Just one problem: we can't legally use that property until I'm an adult."

"This tournament is supposed to be for of-age mages only, right?" Luna asked. "So what happens when your name comes out and they force you to compete?"

"By their own rules, I should be considered an adult, then," Elysia responded, thinking it through. "But that's why I'm getting a solicitor. If I'm to be stuck in this thing, I'm going to milk it for all it's worth."

### Great Hall, Hogwarts	1994/10/31 17:00	Samhain

The Goblet of Fire had been placed in the entrance hall the night before, with the headmaster's vaunted age line around it. Over the course of the day, many students had tried to place their names in the Goblet. The Durmstrang students all put theirs in as soon as they were able the night before, and the Beauxbatons students entered theirs first thing that morning. The Weasley twins spent the day sporting long white beards fit to rival Dumbledore's, which was apparently caused by trying to cross the age line while underage.

For Elysia and her friends, though, it was just another Monday. They entered the Great Hall after a thoroughly engaging class on various types of trip-wire rune schemes, which included the age line. It occurred to Elysia, though, that getting past the age line was as simple as asking someone who was of-age to enter your name for you, and said as much to the Weasley twins.

"Why didn't you just ask Angelina to put your names in?"

They both face-palmed. "Why _didn't_ we, Gred?"

"Dunno, Forge. Hey, Angelina!"

"Hey, Angelina!" Ron piped up. "Can you enter mine too?"

"That's a pretty glaring hole in the defenses, don't you think?" Hermione said.

"It is, and I wish I could say I was surprised. But after the Stone, not to mention the dog's breakfast that was security around here after Sirius escaped from Azkaban... face it, Professor Dumbledore doesn't exactly have a good track record." Elysia replied.

"Not to mention the troll in first year," Hermione said. "Sending students whose Houses are in the dungeons -- where the troll was reported -- _back_ to the dungeons, instead of simply putting the Great Hall into lockdown... what goes through that man's head I'll never know."

"And he'll never admit his mistakes unless his hand is forced, either," Luna said. "You can tell; his image is so carefully cultivated. Ooh, bouillabaisse!"

The Opening Feast that night was quite the event even for a Hogwarts feast. Aside from each school's representatives, delegates from the British Ministry were present -- Elysia recognized Ludo Bagman and Bartemius Crouch from the World Cup. And the menu was much expanded -- it featured traditional cuisine from both visiting schools' cultures (including bouillabaisse). Indeed, the house-elves had outdone themselves. Elysia was enjoying a helping of veal _kapama,_ a traditional Bulgarian stew, while Hermione was feeding Luna a bite of her _coq au vin._

"Are you finished wis ze bouillabaisse?" A voice said from behind them.

Elysia turned to find the girl who'd made her think of playing with auras the day before.

"Fine," Luna pouted playfully, in French. "I'll just have to steal more of Hermione's _coq au vin._"

"It's not stealing if I'm actively feeding you, darling," Hermione said, also in French.

"You'll have to excuse my girlfriends," Elysia finally answered the girl, opting for a distinct Quebecois accent in her French. "We're still in the 'disgustingly sappy' phase of things. I'm Elysia, and this is Hermione and Luna."

"Fleur," the girl responded.

"Charmed, I'm sure," Elysia said. "Anyway, here's the bouillabaisse -- or what's left after Luna's had her way with it, at any rate." She waved a hand lazily and floated the half-empty bowl over to a stunned Fleur.

"Did -- did you just do that without a wand?" She gasped.

Elysia laughed, and moved her left hand, which was holding her wand, out from under the table. Of course, she _had_ done it wandlessly, but Fleur didn't need to know that. "Just a bit of legerdemain," she winked.

Fleur smiled. "Of course. Thank you for the bouillabaisse." She turned and went back to her seat.

"What was that little trick about?" Luna asked.

"Just keeping the competition off balance," Elysia breezed. "Oh, that reminds me! Hey Gred! Forge! You lot still taking bets on who gets chosen?"



-----



At last, the food was eaten, the tables cleared, and the lights dimmed. Filch brought in the Goblet, which was full of merrily-dancing blue flames. All conversation died out until it was so quiet you could hear the Goblet's fire crackle softly.

"When your name is called, please come up and exit through the door behind me," Dumbledore instructed. "Now, if I'm not mistaken, the Goblet is ready to make its decision."

The flames suddenly turned from blue to a deep red, and a slip of parchment flew out. Dumbledore snatched it from the air.

"The champion for Durmstrang is Viktor Krum!"

The room applauded as Krum stood, gave a jerky bow, and stalked out the door to the anteroom. He moved awkwardly, as if he were only ever at home on a broomstick. Elysia could relate, to some degree.

The Goblet flashed red again.

"The champion for Beauxbatons is Fleur Delacour!"

The same blonde girl from earlier stood, curtseyed to the crowd, and promenaded through the anteroom door to cheers and wolf-whistles, mostly from the boys.

The Goblet flashed red a third time.

"The champion for Hogwarts is Cedric Diggory!"

The cheers Cedric received were the loudest yet, especially from the Hufflepuff table. He stood with a grin and a wave, and followed the others to the anteroom.

"Congratulations to our three champions," Dumbledore said. "And now --"

The Goblet flashed red.

The crowd erupted in confused murmurs as Dumbledore read the slip of parchment silently.

"Miss Potter? A word, if you please," he called.

Elysia stood, confusion plastered across her face. "Headmaster?"

"To me, please," he instructed.

She joined him at the front, surreptitiously casting a wandless privacy paling. His eyes widened at that.

"It seems we have much to discuss, Miss Potter," he said.

"I'm sure we do, sir, but I don't think this is the time for most of it," she replied.

"Indeed. Miss Potter, I'll get right to it. Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?"

She glanced at the parchment, which read '_Harry_ Potter,' and snorted. "Of course not, sir! Aside from the fact that _my name isn't Harry,_ I have better things to do than put my life on the line for a pittance of galleons and the idle chatter of sheep."

He sighed. "Such disillusion for one so young."

She shrugged.

"In any case," he continued, "legally, your name _is_ still Harry. Let us discuss this turn of events with the rest of the Tournament officials. Please come with me to the anteroom."

"If I must," she said. "I feel I should warn you: if I am forced to compete, I shall have no choice but to involve my solicitor."

"I see," Dumbledore replied sadly. "Well, needs must. If you please," he gestured to the door.

"Something's just occurred to me," Elysia said. "This lot are all going to think I cheated my way into the Tournament. And _that's_ just not on." She dispelled the privacy paling and drew her wand.

"Elysia?" Dumbledore asked warily.

"Everyone?" Elysia said, pitching her voice to carry without need of a _sonorous_ charm. "I swear on my life and magic that I did not enter myself into this tournament, nor did I ask someone of-age to enter my name for me. So mote it be."

There was a flash, and she lit the end of her wand.

"Let's get this over with, Headmaster," she growled, and stalked through the door.



-----



An incandescent rage was bubbling just below the surface of Elysia's stony face as she swept into the anteroom.

"Potter?" Cedric asked. "What is it?"

"Do zey want us back in ze Hall?" Fleur asked.

Viktor just cocked an eyebrow.

Elysia ignored them all. "Robbie?"

Robbie popped in. "Ellie?"

"Could you bring the solicitor, please? Things are about to get ugly."

Robbie snapped a salute and popped away, returning a few seconds later with an older woman dressed in formal robes.

"Miss Potter? I'm Andromeda Tonks," she introduced herself with a handshake.

Further discussion was interrupted as Dumbledore entered with the other Tournament officials.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Ludo Bagman crowed. "As impossible at it seems, allow me to introduce the _fourth_ Tri-Wizard Champion!" He gestured to Elysia, who growled and flared an aura of existential terror aimed squarely at him. He paled and sank into a chair with a whimper as his knees gave out.

"Not if my solicitor has anything to say about it," she spat.

"It's a binding magical contract," Crouch said flatly, to no-one in particular. "She'll lose her magic if she doesn't compete."

Elysia growled again as the room erupted in outrage. Leaning over to Andromeda, she whispered, "if you can't get me out of this, see if you can leverage it into getting me emancipated. The adults in my life have dropped the ball where I'm concerned far too often."

She tuned back into the wider conversation just as Fleur was saying, "zo zis leetle girl is to compete?"

_Little girl!?_ Elysia's already-enraged temper flared, as did an aura of sheer, overwhelming terror mixed with despairing inadequacy, directed solely at Fleur, who squeaked, flushed beet-red, and sank into a chair with wide, tear-filled eyes. _Call_ me _a little girl, will you? I could crush you like a bug and make you_ like _it. Any of us could._ Thoughts of her girlfriends swam to the fore of her mind as she began to calm down.

_Ellie, love?_ Luna asked, concern coloring her thoughts. _Are you OK?_

_Inexplicably furious,_ Elysia responded. _Not sure why; it's not like we didn't see this coming._

_Because things like this seem to always happen to you and it gets old?_ Luna replied.

_Yeah, that's probably part of it,_ Elysia said. _And also the Tournament officials are_ so _condescending!_

_We'll go blow something up in the Room of Requirement when you're done there, love,_ Luna said. _And after your oh-so-public Oath, nobody believes you cheated your way into the Tournament. Even_ Malfoy _doesn't, though he_ is _quite vocally calling Dumbledore's abilities into question._

_Wow, Malfoy and I agree on something,_ Elysia said, shocked. _Seen any pigs flying lately?_

_No, but lots of nargles and wrackspurts both._

_That's not good, is it?_

_No, probably not. Good luck, Ellie!_

_Thanks. Love you!_

_Love you too!_

Elysia tuned back in to hear the heads of the three school arguing about how it was unfair that Hogwarts had two champions. Crouch said, "It is too late. The Goblet has already gone out."

Elysia rolled her eyes. "So draw straws or something! The Goblet is obviously a bit broken, right now, so choose your second champions some other way. Honestly!"

The officials gaped at her.

"But," Bagman said, "we've only prepared for _three_ champions! Three champions, three tasks!"

"And yet here _I_ am, being forced to compete anyway," she retorted. "You would've had to rework things regardless."

"The girl has a point," Karkaroff said. "Perhaps ve could add some new tasks, as vell. Nothing so arduous as all that to organize," he temporalized. "A simple duel."

"I like zis," Maxime said. "Make it _two_ duels -- one wanded, one wizout. Zat leaves just one more task to add."

Elysia shrugged. "Seeker's duel? I know at least three of us are seekers. Fleur, do you play quidditch, by chance?"

"_Non,_" Fleur said. "But I _do_ race."

The other three champions' eyes lit up.

"That'll work," Cedric grinned.

"Well, that settles everything rather nicely," Dumbledore said.



-----



"May I have your attention?" Dumbledore called, as everyone filed back into the Great Hall. "Due to unforeseen circumstances, each school will now have _two_ champions. The second champion for Hogwarts is Elysia Potter!"

Elysia waved shyly as the students erupted -- most cheered, though there were a few boos mixed in.

"The additional Durmstrang and Beauxbatons champions will be announced tomorrow at dinner," Dumbledore continued. "The first task, a full-contact broom race, will take place in two weeks, on Saturday the 12th, with the second task on Saturday, November the 26th. It's designed to test the champions' ability to think on their feet, so I shall say no more. And now, off to bed with you!"

Elysia reunited with her girlfriends with much hugging and kissing, until they were interrupted by Solicitor Tonks.

"May I have a word, Miss Potter?"

"Of course," she replied. "Let's find somewhere more private."

They adjourned to an unused classroom, where Hermione conjured a sofa and an armchair as Luna cast several privacy palings. They flanked Elysia on the sofa, while Mrs. Tonks took the armchair, shuffling through a briefcase for a moment.

"I confess, ma'am, that I'm in a bit of a daze," Elysia said. "How bad is it?"

"Not as bad as it could be, Miss Potter," she replied. "While, yes, you are irrevocably compelled to compete, that _does_ come with some privileges and concessions. For instance, you are now exempt from the end-of-year exams, may skip any classes you wish in order to prepare for the tasks, and are allowed a certain degree of immunity regarding interference. In short, if someone or something gets in the way of you competing, you are legally within your rights to, ahem, _handle_ it as you see fit."

The girls gasped. "Are you saying I can get away with murder?" Elysia asked.

"Well," Mrs. Tonks said hesitantly. "I would hope not _murder,_ as such, but anything short? Almost certainly."

"Well _that's_ food for thought," Hermione said.

"What's more, between that stipulation and the Ministry's -- apparently legally-binding -- rule of restricting the Tournament to only those of-age, I'm almost positive we can leverage emancipation from tonight's events."

"Excellent," Elysia said. "Can we also get my named legally changed to Elysia Lily Potter? And is there anything more you need from me tonight?"

"Certainly, and no, I don't believe I need anything more from you tonight. That Oath you swore makes my job much easier."

"Great. Then if you'll excuse us, ma'am, I need to go blow off some steam."
