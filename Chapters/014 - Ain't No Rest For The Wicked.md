## Chapter 14: Ain't No Rest For The Wicked

A lot of things happened very quickly once the Goblet issue was settled, and Elysia found it hard to pay attention the next day. There had apparently been a party in the Gryffindor common room, but she'd stayed in the Room of Requirement until well past curfew with Luna and Hermione, alternately snogging and blowing things up. They finally shadow-walked back to their dorms around midnight, glad that the wards only stopped apparition.

She'd written Sirius first thing in the morning, telling him about how she'd already contacted Eberhardt, Bulstrode, & Tonks about the matter, but it looked like she was stuck competing. She embedded a password-protected portkey to the Kiln, saying that if he absolutely could not stay away, it would take him somewhere safe to stay and to call for Robbie when he arrived.

She spent History class in Elysium, plotting with Janet, Robbie, and her parents. Hermione was a bit annoyed, but understood.

"Assuming you _do_ get emancipated," Lily said, "the Kiln would make for a fantastic base of operations. There's a ritual room in the basement, right James? You could do the Unlimited Flight Imbuement and Morphogenesis rituals there."

"And Sirius could stay there, too, until you catch the rat," James added. "Don't look at me like that! You _know_ he won't want to stay away once he knows you're neck-deep in it again."

"Another resource you can tap," Janet said, "is the basilisk remains. Those things won't rot for _years,_ because of the venom, so you can keep the skin for armor and sell the rest for an absolute _fortune._"

"Can't we just shift that into place instead of wearing it separately?" Elysia asked.

"You could," Janet replied, "but if it's separate, you can add enchantments. Contingency runes on the inner lining, and so forth."

"Fair enough. Robbie or I will drop in on Claymore first chance, then."

"Miss Potter," Professor McGonagall said as Transfiguration let out. "A word, please?"

"Of course, Professor," she said.

"You may stay as well, Miss Granger," McGonagall said, as the last of the students filed out. "I just want to check in with our young champion here. Now, _officially,_ I'm not allowed to help you with the tournament itself," she winked. "But then, I do believe you'll give them all a run for their money in the broom race," she smiled.

Elysia smirked. "I certainly hope so, Professor. If I'm stuck competing, I might as well take it seriously. And if I can't hold my own on a broom, I might as well forfeit and go live as a muggle right now."

"Make us proud, Miss Potter," McGonagall said.



-----



An owl arrived over lunch from Elysia's solicitor.

> Miss Potter,
>
> As expected, it was a simple matter to confirm your emancipation, and without even needing the signature of your current guardian. We also got your name legally changed with no issues. Please sign the enclosed form (with your new name) and tap it with your wand.
>
> A pleasure working with you,
>
> Andromeda N. Tonks, Esq.

Elysia immediately read and signed the form. Once she tapped it with her wand, it disappeared with a flash. The owl had long since stolen a sausage and departed.

"It's official," she told her girlfriends. _Let's duck out and do the_ Fidelius _after Potions._

_I'll have to skip History,_ Luna said. _No great loss there._



> To Do:

> - [x] Take over the affairs of House Potter

-----



"Hey, Potter," Malfoy called as Elysia approached the Potions classroom. "Scared yet? You're going to get eaten alive in the first task!"

Ron scoffed. "It's a _broom race,_ Malfoy."

Malfoy rolled his eyes. "_Obviously,_ Weasel. A _full-contact_ broom race. You know, with spells and such. One slip and BOOM! No more Potter."

Elysia laughed. "Can't get rid of me _that_ easily, Malfoy."

Millie and Tracey came up behind Malfoy. "Hey, Heart-Breaker. You good?"

Elysia sighed. "Not you too, Millie!"

Millie just laughed.

"Yeah, I'm good. Malfoy was just asking about my feelings on the race."

"That's charitable," Ron muttered.

"And trying to get a rise out of Ron," Elysia added, winking at Malfoy, who blushed. Ron, meanwhile, gaped like an affronted trout.

_Turning all Malfoy's taunting into him flirting with Ron is_ hilarious, Hermione said, cracking up over the legilimency link. _They both get so worked up about it!_

_Thing is, I think it might be true, at least a bit,_ Elysia responded.

_What, Ron and Malfoy?_ Luna chimed in from her own class. _I give it 'til end of term. Also, if Malfoy's cis I'm a crumple-horned snorkack. Even_ I _wasn't that bad at being a boy._

It was Elysia's turn to crack up.



-----



After Potions (wherein, over legilimency, Elysia asked Snape what bits of the basilisk he wanted before it was sold off), the triad met with Robbie in Elysia's trunk. He'd already set up a gate in place of the door to the training room. They all trooped through it, and came out of what had once been a hall closet in the Kiln's farmhouse.

"Really, bro?" Elysia said. "Coming out of the closet?"

Robbie cackled.

They moved into the greatroom, which was now dust-free and partially furnished.

"Wow, Robbie, did you do all this?" Hermione asked. "This place was one giant dust bunny over the summer!"

Robbie nodded. "I figured, while I was at Gringotts getting a basilisk-harvesting team contracted, I'd grab some stuff from the vault and get this place presentable. Especially if Sirius is crashing here soon."

"How'd that go, by the way?" Elysia asked.

"Well enough. We got the flat fee, which is going to end up making us some serious coin," Robbie replied. "They'll meet us in the Entrance Hall tomorrow morning at 08:30." He shook his head. "I still can't believe you killed that thing, Ellie, much less with a bloody _sword._ I'm just glad I can watch your back properly now."

"Me too. No more sending rogue bludgers at me," Elysia grinned.

"Wouldn't work anymore anyway; you'd just disintegrate it or something."

"True, true. Well, let's get to it!"

Luna and Hermione both shifted to their animagus forms. Luna was a raven, whom Lily had named Hecate, and Hermione was a burrowing owl, whom Lily named Athena. (James was banned from naming the girls' forms, as his suggestions were unilaterally childish. "Stilts and Beaky, James? _Honestly!_ No.") Elysia joined them as Nemesis, her peregrine falcon form, and Robbie shifted into a magpie. Each grabbed a pre-carved, shrunken runestone in their claws and took off for a corner of the property, settled their runestones into place, and met back at the farmhouse a scant few minutes later.

Hermione performed the ritual, making Elysia the Secret Keeper. She then promptly told the others the secret, and they trooped back into the closet and into the trunk-flat.

"We've got a couple of hours left until dinner," Luna said.

"Cuddle-pile and a movie?" Elysia suggested.

"Perfect," Hermione said.



-----



Dinner was delayed in serving due to the announcement of the remaining two champions, much to Ron's dismay.

"The Durmstrangers all look a bit roughed-up. Think they chose theirs with a free-for-all?" Elysia mused.

"I wouldn't put it past them," Hermione said.

"The second champion for Durmstrang is Anna Kozlov!" Dumbledore announced.

A slim girl with a hard-looking face and unnaturally-straight brown hair glided up to the front. She moved like a dancer -- or a fighter. Maybe both.

"And the second champion for Beauxbatons is Izabella Maradona!"

A short, curvy girl with hair a lot like Elysia's, only with purple highlights, bounced up to the front. She beamed brightly and waved to the crowd, her violet eyes sparkling like finely-cut amethysts.

"She seems nice," Luna commented.

"As a reminder to our champions," Dumbledore continued, "the traditional Weighing of the Wands ceremony will occur this Friday afternoon after lunch here in the Great Hall, followed by a press conference and photo-shoot. And a reminder to the other students, this is a closed event. Thank you, and enjoy this delicious repast the Hogwarts house-elves have provided us!"

"Finally!" Ron said, somehow already with a mouth full of food.

### Chamber of Secrets, Hogwarts	1994/11/02 08:30

The next morning Elysia and company met the Gringotts team in the Entrance Hall.

"Ah, Miss Potter," Claymore said. "When I heard about the basilisk I just had to come see for myself."

"Good to see you, Claymore," Elysia said. "And I thought I told you, call me Ellie. Gold still flowing, heads still rolling?"

Claymore laughed. "Always, Ellie."

Elysia introduced Claymore to everyone else, and they managed to get to Myrtle's bathroom before Dumbledore was any the wiser.

"The entrance was _here?_" Snape asked incredulously.

"Yup," Elysia replied. "Go figure, right? _Open,_" she added, in Parseltongue.

The sink swiveled out of the way, revealing the same dingy oversized pipe sloping down and out of sight.

"I mean," she continued, "I doubt it _started out_ as a ladies' loo, but then again who would ever think to look _there_ for the hidden entrance to a legendary secret chamber? _Stairs,_" she hissed, and gestured for everyone to follow.

They continued on, passing the cave-in, which Snape transfigured into something sturdier and more easily passed, and the shed skin, which the goblins promptly stuffed in a bottomless sack.

"Eep!" Luna squeaked at the sight of it. "And if that's a _shed_ skin, that means..." She paled and clung tightly to Elysia's arm. Hermione paled at her words and did the same on Elysia's other side.

Eventually they came to the doors carved with snakes, their emerald eyes glinting in the wandlight. They still lay ajar, and eerie shadows danced in the poisonous green light of magical torches.

"Honestly, Salazar," Elysia muttered. "_Working lights,_" she hissed. The room brightened considerably, and the torches changed to a neutral hue closer to daylight. "Much better."

"Salazar's saggy arse," Snape breathed, as they caught sight of the slain basilisk.

"Language, Russ," Elysia sang.

"Sorry, Lily -- erm..." He replied, blushing.

Elysia cackled. "Sorry, sir, couldn't resist."

Snape snorted. "I'm sure."

"I thought I'd imagined how big it was," Ginny said softly, face pale. "I thought I'd come down and see it again and it wouldn't look nearly so enormous. But it _does. Bigger,_ even."

"You wanna kick it?" Elysia asked.

"What?"

"Go on, kick it! Give it a good one, right in the snoot. You too, Hermione," Elysia said. "Boot the snoot!"

"Boot the snoot! Boot the snoot!" Luna took up the chant.

Nell giggled nervously.

"A-alright," Ginny said. She strode purposefully over to the giant snake, wound up, and let fly fit to make a star striker jealous.

"Oh my _gosh,_ that's _so_ cathartic!" She gushed. "Hermione, you've _got_ to try it!" She gave it a few more for good measure before Hermione took her place.

Hermione threw a spinning roundhouse with a channeled banisher. The giant snake, all 42 tons of it, actually slid back a bit, with a visible shock-wave rippling down its length.

"Sweet Merlin in a bucket, Hermione, you hit like a freight train!" Ginny gasped.

Hermione smiled bashfully. "I've been training with Luna and Ellie."

"How, by dead-lifting the giant squid?" Nell quipped.

"I want in," Ginny said.

"Me too," Nell agreed.

"Alright. Ron?" Elysia asked.

Ron shook his head. "Nuh-uh. I know when I'm out of my depth. 'Sides, I'm a teenage boy. I need my beauty sleep."

Hermione rolled her eyes.

Luna was wandering around looking at the Chamber. "Hey, I think this place is a ritual room! Or was, at any rate."

"That makes sense," Hermione said. "Isn't the Wardstone Chamber down here somewhere too?"

"I think so," Elysia said. "They both connect to the access tunnels, anyway, but then, isn't that the point of access tunnels?"

"Wardstone Chamber?" Snape asked. "What _have_ you girls been up to?"

"We were looking at that broken old lightning ward, and found out where the curse on the Defense Professorship is," Elysia said. "We looked into it. It's an ongoing project."

"Ah," Snape said faintly. "What's this about a lightning ward?"

That set Hermione off. "It turns out the reason that muggle technology _supposedly_ doesn't work at Hogwarts is because some _imbecile_ raised a generalized anti-electricity ward instead of just installing a lightning rod like a sensible person."

"Never mind that this was, of course, centuries before muggles had found a use for electricity in the first place," Snape threw in sardonically.

"Yes, well," Hermione said, biting her lip. "We fixed it."

"You _fixed_ it."

Hermione nodded, and they told him all about their foray via the Room of Requirement.

"So you mean to tell me," he said finally, "that a gaggle of fourth-years --"

"And third-years!" Luna piped up.

"-- snuck into the Hogwarts Wardstone Chamber, a place that is near mythical in both its protections and _mere existence,_ and _fixed_ the most intractable reason for the magical world's technological stagnation _in an afternoon?_"

They nodded cautiously.

"_You mean to tell me,_" he continued, "that you have proven conclusively that there is, in fact, a curse on the Defense Professorship, _and_ are well on the way to 'fixing' that as well?"

They nodded again.

"_You mean to tell me,_" he finished, a wide grin breaking upon his face, "that I can _finally_ get some decent music in this place?"

"Movie nights, too," Luna added happily, bouncing on her toes a bit.

"Hallelujah!" Snape cried. It was genuine, and both Ron and Nell were completely gobsmacked.

Elysia couldn't help it -- she broke down giggling, and soon everyone else joined in.



-----



"You know," Hermione said, "we really ought to properly document this beast while we still can."

"There's always a pensieve," Elysia said. "Pretty sure you can take pictures from inside one. And the goblins can tell us its measurements."

"I guess that's good enough," Hermione said.



-----



"I've been meaning to ask, Elysia," Snape said. "How are you handling the whole Tournament situation?"

Elysia shrugged. "Honestly, I'm resigned to it. Some good things have come from it, I guess, but I _hate_ standing out over something I had no say in."

Snape snorted. "You're a Potter. You'd stand out anyway. It's in your blood. But look at it this way: you may not have entered of your own volition, but you can compete on your terms. Own it, do the best you are able, and do it in style."

"That's a good point," Elysia said. "Hmm. Style. You've a flair for the dramatic, sir; what would _you_ do?"

"Well," Snape smirked, "as any Slytherin knows, setting the right tone is paramount. And the best way to do _that_ is with music."

"The Hat _did_ want to put me in Slytherin at first," Elysia mused. "So, what, I should play the rock star?"

"If the hype fits. You are aware, I presume, of the 'Power Walk' trope?"

"Like pro wrestlers?"

Snape nodded. "Do that. Walk in with a soundtrack, and _own_ it."

"Like you do with your classes! Do you have a song in your head when you sweep in like you do?"

"Of course! Black Sabbath's 'The Wizard,' usually, if you can believe that. It came out the year I started Hogwarts, and it always seemed to fit so well."

"Seriously?" Elysia cackled. "That's -- that's --"

"Hilarious, I know," Snape said with a Cheshire cat grin.

-----



Eventually, the goblins didn't need them around anymore, and they tired of exploring the Chamber. They all went their separate ways, with the fourth-years making for Charms and the others their own classes. Snape swept off to teach, and now that he'd mentioned it, Elysia could match his stride to Geezer Butler's relentless rhythm as his cloak flared dramatically.

All through Charms she turned the idea over in her head. They were starting Summoning Charms -- which as a staple combat spell Elysia knew backwards, forwards, upside-down, and wandless -- so she was left with quite a bit of time to think. Eventually, she dropped into Elysium to talk with her parents about it.

"Padfoot and I were quite the hellions back in school," James said when she asked. "Those dragonhide boots and jackets were ours, actually. You've got Lily's, and Robbie's got mine. So that's a good start right there."

"They really do go with almost everything," Lily agreed.

"So I'll run with that, then. Hard-femme rocker-chic aesthetic, cocky strut, rock-star attitude. Ugh, Russ is never going to let me live that down, is he?"

Lily snorted. "Like he doesn't do the exact same thing with Sabbath? If I recall, this _was_ his idea in the first place."

"As if that'd stop him."

"So whistle the harmonica part at him," James said.

Lily and Elysia cracked up.

"Okay, so music, then," Elysia finally said. "I at least need a song for the Weighing of the Wands, though if we can think of a good one for the broom race too I wouldn't say no."

"What's that nickname your friends keep calling you? Heart-Breaker?" Lily asked. "Isn't that a Pat Benatar song?"

"That's perfect!" James cried.

"Ooh, I _like_ it!" Elysia said. "So what about the broom race? I'm planning to strip the limiter on my Firebolt, rig a full enclosure on the windscreen charm, and use the Unlimited Flight ritual for inertial compensation. If they can catch me, they bloody well _deserve_ to win."

"It's full-contact, right?" Lily asked. "Drop a wave of stun lightning behind you as you go."

"Firebolts and lightning: very, very frightening!" James cackled.

"No, Bohemian Rhapsody's got the wrong vibe." Lily retorted.

"I rather like Judas Priest. 'Living After Midnight,' maybe?" Elysia said.

"For the walk-up, sure," Lily said. "But during the race, I'm thinking something faster. Metallica's 'Seek & Destroy?'"

"No, save that for the duels," Elysia said. "It'll have more impact once they know what I can do. For this, I want them eating my dust while their faces melt off, not shaking in their boots beforehand."

James and Lily looked at each other. "Motörhead."

"_Hell_ yes," Elysia said.



-----



Over lunch, she had Robbie take their jackets to Madame Malkin for some custom work. When they came back the next evening, hers had 'Nemesis' embroidered across the back in glistening blood-red thread. Robbie's had 'Hermes' in a glimmering silver. She also placed an order for sets for Luna and Hermione for Yule, and got matching pairs of auror-grade mage-space wand holsters for each of them. (Robbie didn't use a wand, but the space could be used for anything, so it was still useful.)



-----



"You lied to me, Miss Potter," Professor Moody said that Thursday as class ended. With her cover identity blown upon her selection as a champion, Elysia had long since decided to change her eyes back to her mother's vibrant green. The scar stayed gone, though.

"About being from Canada?" 

Moody nodded.

"With respect, sir," Elysia responded, "you're an unknown quantity. And Hogwarts doesn't exactly have the best track record with Defense professors. Besides," she smirked. "You bought it. Constant vigilance, Professor!"



-----

### Great Hall, Hogwarts	1994/11/04 13:00

Finally, Friday came, and with it the Weighing of the Wands. She'd already gotten the day's assignment from Snape, and Robbie had acquired a boom-box with a 6-disc CD changer. They'd charmed it to run off of an ambient magic tap instead of batteries, since otherwise it would devour them like Ron devoured dessert, and prepped the wardrobe change in her trunk. Janet had warned her about Rita Skeeter, and Elysia had decided to see if she could be brought onside. If not, well. Who could fault someone 'accidentally' squashing a bug?

Lunch ended, and her girlfriends kissed her goodbye and wished her luck. She shadow-walked to her trunk, changed into tight jeans, a black AC/DC tee, and her dragonhide, and shadow-walked back to an empty classroom near the Great Hall. Robbie joined her, similarly-attired (with a Queen tee) and boom-box in tow. He also wore a gold pendant with the Potter crest in enamel.

The pair waited under her invisibility cloak outside the Great Hall until everyone else was inside.

"3. 2. 1. Let's jam!" Robbie said, pressing Play. Ellie Banished the doors open and sauntered in, Benatar's dulcet tones blaring as Robbie, boom-box held overhead, followed right behind her.

The effect was better than she could've hoped.

The Great Hall turned out to have downright _amazing_ acoustics, and her entrance, stately yet swaggering, drew the eye of everyone in the room and held it.

The press were eating it up -- Rita's quill was a green blur, and her photographer was clicking away like a metronome. Crouch stared stiffly ahead, while Bagman bobbed his head with a delighted smile. Karkaroff smirked. Madame Maxime grinned. Cedric's jaw was on the floor. Krum nodded appreciatively. Anna was tapping a foot, and Elysia could almost swear she saw a smile for a second. Fleur sniffed disdainfully, but was also blushing fiercely. And Izabella...

Izabella threw the horns and started dancing.

But the best reactions were Dumbledore and Ollivander. Dumbledore wore a look of shock and dismay, which almost made Elysia break stride and break down giggling. Ollivander, though, was actually playing air-guitar.

_That's one for the pensieve,_ Elysia grinned.

"Woo, _arraio,_ now _that's_ an entrance!" Izabella said when Robbie faded the music out. "You've got _style!_ Potter, right?"

"That's right," Elysia said with a grin.

"Izabella Maradona. But you can call me Izzy."

"Call me Ellie, then. You're from Beauxbatons, yeah?"

"Yup!" She bounced a bit. "It's kinda _botika,_ but it's nice," she said _sotto voce._

"_I'm sure, if Miss Delacour is any indication,_" Elysia answered in Euskara, recognizing the word '_botika_' as 'snooty'. "_Her nose gets any higher, we'll be able to see up it._"

Izzy giggled. "_We're not_ all _that bad. Wait, you speak Euskara?_"

"_It turns out my family has roots there,_" Elysia answered. "_Way,_ way _back, like over a millennium, we were known as Eltzegilea. Not sure when we ended up in England, come to think of it. I picked up the language over the summer so I could read the older family records._"

"_Hem, hem,_" Dumbledore interjected. "Now that our final champion has arrived, perhaps we can get started?"

Elysia rolled her eyes. "I walked in not 30 seconds after Cedric."

"Yes, well." Dumbledore said, looking uncomfortable. "Master Ollivander, if you would?"

Ollivander bowed. "Certainly, Headmaster. Miss Kozlov, you first."

Anna prowled over and handed Ollivander her wand. He started as it touched his hand, and he peered closely at it. 

"Oh my. Prickly ash, quite solid. Just shy of 11^7/10^ inches. And..." His eyes widened. "_Zmey sinew?_ I hadn't realized Gregorovitch had expanded his repertoire so." He waved the wand, and a blossom of silver fire erupted from the tip, accompanied by the tinkling of tiny bells. "Lovely."

Anna bobbed a curtsey as she took her wand and stepped back.

"Miss Delacour?"

Fleur stepped forward and handed over her wand.

"Hmm, yes. Rosewood, 9^1/2^ inches, inflexible, containing... dear me."

"An 'air from ze 'head of my grandmuzzair, a full-blooded veela," Fleur finished.

"Quite. I've never used veela hair myself, of course. I find it to be rather temperamental, but I imagine it _would_ suit you given the family relation. Lovely workmanship as well. Beauvais family?"

Fleur nodded. "Valentina."

Ollivander waved the wand, and with a muttered spell a bouquet of roses sprouted from the end. He handed both the bouquet and the wand to Fleur, who took them and stepped back.

"Mister Diggory!" Ollivander called.

Cedric stepped forward and offered up his wand.

"Ah, one of my own creations," Ollivander said with a smile. "Ash, and a tail-hair from a particularly ornery unicorn stallion. 12^1/4^ inches, pleasantly springy, and in fine condition. You treat it regularly?"

Cedric grinned. "Polished it last night!"

Elysia snorted. "I bet you did."

Izzy stifled a giggle.

Cedric blushed at his accidental double-entendre. 

Ollivander rescued him by waving the wand, sending a stream of silver smoke rings puffing around the group before handing it back.

"Mister Krum, if you would?"

Krum slouched forward and thrust his wand into Ollivander's hand, then stood scowling with his hands in his pockets.

"Ah, another Gregorovich creation!" He pronounced. "Hornbeam, 10^1/4^ inches, and... hmm, yes... dragon heart-string, quite rigid, rather thicker than one usually sees. _Avis!_" With a loud _bang,_ a flock of small birds appeared and flew out the owl-doors in the eaves. He returned the wand to Krum, and the boy slouched back.

"Only our two youngest champions left," Ollivander rubbed his hands excitedly. "Miss Maradona, if you please?"

Izzy bounded over and handed over her wand, bouncing on her toes as Ollivander examined it.

"Now _this_ is unusual," he exclaimed. "A Quintana family creation; it has similar embellishment to old Thiago's work. Tomás, perhaps? I haven't seen the like in quite some time. Black walnut, 11 inches, and surprisingly bendy. And... goodness me. Is that a _matagot whisker_ for a core?"

"Yup!" Izzy said.

"How apropos," Ollivander said faintly. He swished the wand, sending a stream of opalescent bubbles spewing forth. As they popped, faint giggling could be heard. He handed the wand back, and Izzy hopped back.

"And last, but certainly not least," Ollivander said. "Miss Potter!"

Elysia popped her wand from its holster, flipped it around her index finger like a knife, and extended it to Ollivander handle-first.

"Yes, how well I remember. Holly, 11 inches, quite supple, and with a feather from a particularly fine phoenix."

Elysia grinned. "I'll pass on your compliments to Fawkes."

Dumbledore looked startled at that.

"Quite," Ollivander said. "For all that it's clearly well-maintained, this wand has seen some excitement, Miss Potter."

Elysia shrugged. "Some of us actually _use_ our wands," she said, with a smirk at the others. "Those acid burns, for instance: venom splash from the basilisk I slew in second year. Big one, too -- fangs the size of my arm, and the goblins said it measured 64 feet long, nearly 6 feet across, and weighed in at just shy of 42 tons. And those slight scorch marks there by the tip: an overchanneled _Patronus_ charm last June. Ran off the entire cohort of dementors the Ministry had guarding against Sirius Black -- something like a hundred of the cursed things -- when they swarmed my friends and I. And that off-color streak there: when we took out a troll in first year."

The others were gaping. Dumbledore just hung his head, pinching the bridge of his nose.

"I've always felt that a wand is like a _judoka's_ belt," Elysia continued. "The wear is a record and a reminder of what you've gone through to get where you are. Like scars. I look at mine and think, _I'm still alive. Look what I survived._" She shrugged. "I mean, it's either that or go a bit mad, yeah?"

"_Neska beldurgarria, madarikatua,_" Izzy breathed.

"And yet, you hide your most distinctive scar," Rita finally piped up. "Why is that, Elysia -- can I call you Elysia?"

"I didn't _earn_ that one, Rita -- can I call you Rita?" Elysia said. "Let's talk after, and I'll tell you what _really_ happened there. Anyway, it's been nothing but trouble, so I had it removed the muggle way a few days ago. It's been hidden with make-up before that." _Damn, I'm getting a bit too good at lying through my teeth._ C'est la vie.

"I find it hard to believe such outlandish tales," Karkaroff scoffed. "You are but a child."

Elysia crossed her arms. "I can show you some memories, if you insist. Actually, yeah, let's do that. Robbie? The pensieve, please."

Robbie popped away and came back a second later, setting the Potter pensieve on the staff table.

"Miss Potter," Ollivander said. "Can you truly cast a corporeal _Patronus?_"

She simply held out her hand for her wand. Ollivander handed it back, and she waved everyone out of the way as she faced the center of the Great Hall.

"_Expecto patronum!_" She proclaimed, thoughts full of Hermione and Luna.

An enormous silvery bird exploded out of her wand, glowing like the sun. Its wingspan was nearly as long as one of the House tables.

"Huh. _That's_ different," She said casually. "It was a stag last June. And not nearly so big."

"_Яички Распутина (yaichki rasputina),_" Anna breathed.

"My word," Ollivander exclaimed. "What a fabulous thunderbird!"

"Extraordinary!" Madame Maxime said.

Dumbledore looked utterly gob-smacked. Karkaroff simply glared.

Rita looked like Yule had come early, and her photographer was clicking away like a rabid Geiger counter.

"I take it we've moved on to the 'press conference' portion of the program?" Bagman asked.

Elysia moved over to Rita Skeeter, casting a surreptitious privacy paling. "Rita, I'll make a deal with you. You play by my rules, and you get all my exclusives."

Rita narrowed her eyes. "I'm listening."

"Nothing too onerous," Elysia said. "Give the rest of the champions equal billing for the Tournament profiles, stick to the truth about me and mine -- no speculating; if something piques your interest, just ask me about it. Odds are I'll tell you, and with plenty of dirt to go with it. And in return, I tell you _all_ about the life and times of the Girl-Who-Lived, including Dumbledore's dirty little secrets. Not to mention what I've got on Fudge."

Rita's eyes gleamed. "Intriguing. But what makes you think you can dictate terms, little girl?"

Elysia's eyes narrowed. "Let's just say a little bug told me a secret of yours." She let slip a targeted aura of unease, just enough for Rita to feel that she meant business.

Rita gulped visibly. "R-right... Okay, we have a deal."

They shook on it, and Elysia dropped the paling.



-----



After Rita grilled all six of them for what felt like hours, but was really closer to only one, they took photos. Rita and her photographer had them pose all together, on their own, and in various group permutations. Elysia's favorite was of her and Izzy playing air-guitar together with Ollivander. She got the photographer to promise to send her a copy of that one, whether it made it to press or not.

They also took a trip into the pensieve, to view carefully-selected memories of the troll-fight in first year, the basilisk in second year, and the routing of the dementors in third. They all emerged shaken, clearly seeing Elysia in a new light. Dumbledore was pale, and his face was drawn in a disturbed frown. Rita was clearly bursting with questions, but Elysia took her aside and told her to write them down and they'd meet over lunch on Sunday and do an in-depth interview -- likely the first of many -- and that seemed to satisfy her.

As they were finishing up, Robbie sidled over to mention that Sirius had arrived and called him. 

"Go, make sure he doesn't burn the place down. Take the music with you, maybe it'll distract him."

Robbie laughed. "Right-o!" He slipped the pensieve into his wand-holster pocket, grabbed the boom-box, and popped away.

_No rest for the wicked,_ Elysia thought.
