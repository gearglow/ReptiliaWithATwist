## Chapter 11: Outclassed

### Hogwarts, Classrooms	1994/09/05 08:00

Monday morning found Elysia and Hermione once again greeting a yawning Luna outside the Great Hall at breakfast with fond smiles. Both girls had talked the night before about how quickly Luna had become their friend, and how much they both enjoyed spending time with her.

"I'm so excited for Runes and Arithmancy today!" Hermione gushed.

"Me too!" Luna replied, smiling brightly.

"Swots, the both of you," Elysia teased, and laughed as both girls smacked her on either arm in synchrony. "See? It's not just me and Hermione twinning like that."

"'Hermione and _I_,'" Luna absently corrected, eyes sparkling.

Elysia stuck her tongue out at her as Hermione giggled.

"And what, pray tell, do you plan on doing with that?" Luna asked, cocking one eyebrow.

Elysia's jaw dropped and she blushed brightly. "Um."

Hermione finally lost her composure completely and dragged them both to breakfast, cackling.



+++++



Monday morning was full of of harvesting bubotuber pus in Herbology with the Hufflepuffs, and mounting concern over something Hagrid called 'blast-ended skrewts' in Care of Magical Creatures. Professor Sprout had been forewarned about Elysia's transition, but Hagrid kept looking around for 'Harry' until Elysia came up and reintroduced herself. Elysia and Hermione met up with Luna again at lunch, and then the three of them, accompanied by Neville who was also in the class, headed off to Arithmancy.

Professor Septima Vector was a petite brunette with sharp bob-cut hair and a calculating gaze. She greeted the students with a smile. "This year," she said, "we will begin thaumic analysis. Some of you," she nodded at the three girls, "have demonstrated a degree of experience with this already. Miss Lovegood, if you would?"

Luna moved up to stand at the front of the classroom.

"I'm going to cast a beam of light. Miss Lovegood is going to demonstrate a technique called 'monkey-patching' wherein a spell's parameters are modified after it's been cast. First, here's the unmodified spell. _Lux trabem!_"

A beam of magic, glowing with white light, erupted from her wand, streaming the length of the classroom. She held the beam for a few seconds.

"Alright, Miss Lovegood, show us your stuff! _Lux trabem!_"

Luna, muttering a spell under her breath, flicked her wand in an intricate pattern and the beam split into a rainbow spectrum, lines of glowing white runes intertwined among them. She flicked a few specific places, and swished her wand with a flourish as the beam re-cohered. It was now a thin, intense rod of actinic blue, and was roughly three feet long. A low hum could be heard as Professor Vector slowly waved her wand around. 

Luna grinned, flourished her wand like a fencer, and intoned, "_ense lucis radium!_" A similar beam of glowing, humming magic, this one tinged with fuchsia, extended from the tip of her own wand. The two crossed the beams as if fencing, resulting in a cloud of sparks, then canceled the spells.

The class erupted in applause and cheers.

"I didn't know you'd seen Star Wars, Luna!" Hermione gushed as Luna retook her seat.

"We _definitely_ need a movie night soon," Elysia said.

The rest of the class was an overview and the beginnings of a deeper discussion about the techniques Luna had demonstrated. It turned out that Luna's lightsaber spell, _ense lucis radium,_ was one she'd helped her mother create before she'd died. It was intended as a training aide for fencing lessons, which Luna had continued after her mother's death as a way to still feel close to her.

"Luna," Elysia asked as class let out, "Hermione and I do some training ourselves most mornings. Maybe you'd like to join us? We usually start with a run around the lake about 5:30 or so."

Luna smiled as Hermione nodded enthusiastically. "I'd love to!"



+++++



After Arithmancy was Runes, which Professor Babbling had managed to wrangle as an accelerated track. In addition to Elysia, Hermione, and Luna, the class included Millicent Bulstrode and Tracy Davis from Slytherin, Lisa Turpin from Ravenclaw, and Susan Bones and Megan Jones from Hufflepuff. Hermione noted that there were two students from each house. Elysia noted that there were no boys. Luna noted, smirking, that she was pretty sure none of them were straight (including the professor, if the tattoo of a labrys wreathed in violets on her wrist was any indication).

"Well, ladies," Professor Babbling said with a grin. "Now that it's just the best and brightest this section, we get to jump right into the fun stuff." An enormous Cheshire-cat grin split her face. "Welcome to Curse-Breaking 101."

The girls all cheered.

"Now, you all have a solid grounding in Futhark and Ogham," she continued. "This term, each of you will pick another glyph system to specialize in, and we'll begin to look at the basics of warding and enchanting. Next term, we'll dive into practical applications with some training scenarios, and in our last term of the year we'll have a mock boot camp with some guest instructors from Gringotts."



+++++



The girls all made their way to dinner together after Runes, chattering away excitedly. Elysia, Hermione, and Luna all split off and made for the Gryffindor table, joining Ron, Neville, and Ginny. Ron had a sour look on his face.

"Making nice with snakes?" He grumbled.

Elysia rolled her eyes. "They're not all Malfoy or Parkinson."

"Millicent Bulstrode's positively sweet," Hermione agreed. 

"Didn't she put you in a headlock in second year?" Elysia asked, smirking.

"Yeah," Hermione grinned, exaggerating a dreamy sigh, at which Elysia, Luna, and Ginny all giggled.

"Seriously, those arms, though," Elysia said.

"But they're slimy Slytherins!" Ron shouted.

Ginny smacked him in the back of the head. "Grow up, Ronnikins. Besides, we've all seen you ogling Greengrass."

Ron's ears turned bright red.

### Elysium	1994/09/05 05:20

The next morning, Elysia and Hermione came downstairs for their morning run to find Luna waiting for them in the entrance hall, wearing a baby-blue velvet track-suit that matched her eyes.

"Good morning, you two," she said with her usual adorable yawn.

"Good morning, Luna!" Elysia and Hermione chorused, giggling.

They all trooped out to the shore of the lake, where Elysia led them in a quick warm-up, and then off they jogged for a lap around the lake.

Afterward, Elysia led them up to the Gryffindor fifth-year girls' dorm and down into her trunk. Luna's eyes grew as wide as Hermione's had when she'd first visited, and Elysia made sure to leave the locus room for last again.

"Ellie, this is amazing!" Luna gushed, flitting around the room and examining the rune-work.

"Thanks," Elysia said. "It's my grandmother's work. The modular locus pedestal was her last big breakthrough before she passed, according to her journals. I got to check out my grandparents' old farm over the summer, and there's an entire building built like this there."

"Elysia carved the control stone here," Hermione added.

Luna's eyes narrowed and she stared at Elysia. "These runes are well beyond intro material. There's something _off_ about you, Ellie. What are you hiding?"

Elysia locked eyes with Hermione for a moment. _I know it's only been a week or so, but I want to tell her everything. What do you think?_

Hermione wrinkled her nose. _I say do it. I like her, we both do, and I want her to trust you like I do._

_Do I detect a bit of a crush, Miss Granger?_

_Prat. Like you don't?_

Elysia mentally stuck her tongue out. Hermione responded in kind.

"Luna," Elysia said finally, "let's go to the training room and I'll explain everything."

"Alright," Luna said, leading the way.

They settled into comfortable positions on the mat.

"You're not a time traveler or something, are you?" Luna asked, cocking one eyebrow.

"Not exactly?" Elysia said. "How's your mind magic?"

"Developed, why?" Luna said, making Hermione's jaw drop.

"Wait, what? You know occlumency already?" Hermione gasped.

"Enough. A bit of legilimency too," Luna said. "Mum taught me a bit when my magic first started to show; it's useful for dueling, so she was quite good at it. It's helpful for learning faster, too."

"It is, at that," Elysia agreed. "But fully-developed mind magic is more than just occlumency and legilimency.  Everyone join hands, and Luna, cast legilimency on me."

"Alright," Luna agreed. "But this better lead to some answers!"



+++++



The three of them appeared in Elysium's sunken living area, sharing one of the squashy sofas and still holding hands. Luna looked around with interest.

"You've certainly got some nice houses, Elysia," she said. "Where are we?"

"Welcome to Elysium, my mindscape," Elysia said. "It's a replica of my residence in the after-life."

Luna cocked an eyebrow.

"Long story short," Elysia continued, "I've apparently died a bunch of times, but kept getting sent back to try again because Destiny or something. Anyway, this last time around, Eleanor was there instead of some guy named Michael, who's apparently the usual person in charge of my neighborhood of the afterlife, and Eleanor decided that, since I wasn't allowed to remember my past lives, we'd just have to cheat and stuff a bunch of knowledge and training into my subconscious from the afterlife instead. Hey, Janet?"

"Hi, I'm Janet!" Janet said, suddenly appearing in one of the chairs across from the three girls. Luna jumped.

"Janet's the personification of all knowledge in the universe," Elysia confided. "Or at least, the real Janet is. This one's the personification of all knowledge in my head."

"Close enough," Janet said brightly.

"Anyway, I don't get to remember the afterlife so much, as it turns out. Just the knowledge and training parts, and to pull them into my consciousness there's a library that unlocks them."

"A library?" Luna squealed, making Hermione giggle. "Can we see it? Can I read some of the books?"

Elysia grinned. "You and Hermione, I swear. She reacted almost exactly the same way when I first brought her here over the weekend. Come on, then. Don't overdo it, or you'll be bored silly with Hogwarts classes, but Janet put together a good list."

The girls dove in, with Luna devouring the same reading list as Hermione, and Hermione finishing the list off except for the books on Metamorphmagi and Shifting, which neither girl could make use of without already having latent metamorphmagus abilities already.

Elysia relaxed with some stories about curse-breaking expeditions, as she was still excited about their 'Curse-Breaking 101' class the day before. When they were done, they all adjourned to the trunk's training room to continue their workout.

### Hogwarts, DADA Classroom	1994/09/08 13:00

Rapidly-growing friendship between the girls aside, classes proceeded more or less uneventfully. Potions was much better now that she and Snape were on better terms; even Neville seemed to be having an easier time of things. Arithmancy was fascinating, especially with both Hermione and Luna there with her. Runes, or 'Curse-Breaking 101,' as they all called it now, was rapidly becoming all three girls' favorite class, with Hermione in particular taking to it like she was born for it.

Finally, Thursday rolled around, and with it the first Defense Against the Dark Arts class of the year.

"Constant vigilance!" Janet whispered in the back of Elysia's mind as she approached the classroom.

_Is this going to be another one of those years where the Defense professor tries to kill me?_ Elysia mused. _Lovely._ She set her glasses to active scan as she entered, noting that while Professor Moody was not visible, there _was_ a blob of magic in the back corner of the classroom that was identified as a disillusionment charm. She took a desk in front, conjured a clay ball, quickly press-carved runes for an area-effect flash-bang stunner on a command-word trigger, then over-charged it.

The other students made their way in and took their seats, wondering where Professor Moody was. And then, as the clock ticked over and class began, spell-fire came from the corner. Several students screamed, and many fell to stunners. Elysia promptly hit the deck and rolled the marble towards the corner, casting a quick shield, shifting her ears closed, and shutting her eyes. 

"Boom!" She yelled, triggering her make-shift grenade. There was a blinding flash of light, even through her closed eyelids, and she felt the wash of the pressure wave from the explosion. A crimson wave of stunning magic followed, crackling against her shield as she stood, unsealing her ears and opening her eyes.

The entire class was lying on the floor, stunned, as was the disillusioned lump in the corner. Elysia _reenervated_ Hermione, asking her to revive the rest. She made her way to the corner, casting a quick _finite_ to reveal the still-stunned Professor Moody. 

"What have we here?" She mused aloud. A quick search-and-seizure revealed the professor's wand, two spares, an enchanted flask, a couple of nondescript portkeys, and a collapsible metal baton, all of which she promptly confiscated. She then levitated the erstwhile professor to a chair, bound him with _incarcerous,_ and threw in a _petrificus totalis_ for good measure.

"Someone fetch Professor McGonagall, please," she called behind her.

"I'll go, Ellie," Neville said, suiting action to words.

"Everybody okay?" Elysia asked, as Neville exited stage left.

"I think so," Hermione responded. "Ellie, what happened? The last thing I remember was you yelling 'boom' and everything went white."

Elysia knelt and picked up her conjured clay ball, which she wandlessly dispelled as she stood. "A little something I found in a curse-breaking adventure story - a flash-bang stunner. With the twins constantly repeating 'constant vigilance' after their first Defense class, I figured something was up. And there's not a whole lot who can block an area stunner after a flash-bang breaks their focus."

"How'd you carve one so fast?" Hermione demanded.

"Who says I did?" Elysia said, winking. Over legilimency, she added, _I shifted my palm into a mirror-image etching plate of the runes and pressed them into place._

Hermione nodded in understanding. 

Neville returned with Professor McGonagall, who was looking as stern as ever.

"Miss Potter," she said, "why, perchance, do you have Professor Moody unconscious and tied up at wand-point?"

"Because he attacked us, Professor," she answered sedately.

"What?" Professor McGonagall gasped.

"It's true, Professor," Hermione chimed in. "He was disillusioned at the back of the classroom, and when class started he began firing stunners at us until Elysia stunned him."

Professor McGonagall pinched the bridge of her nose. "Really, Albus?" She muttered under her breath. "_Reenervate,_" she intoned, rousing Professor Moody, who, still under the body-bind, could only blink. "Miss Potter?" She queried. "What _else_ did you do to him?"

"Aside from the stunner and the _incarcerous?_" She replied innocently. "Just a simple body-bind. Better safe than sorry, right, Professor?"

Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and as the body-bind lifted Moody roared with laughter. "Well done, Miss... Potter, was it?"

Elysia nodded.

"Any relation to the illustrious Boy-Who-Lived?"

Elysia's hazel eyes narrowed as she lied through her teeth. "I'm from Canada. D'you have any idea how common the surname 'Potter' is in the mundane world?"

Moody shrugged. "Fair enough, lass."

"But-" Ron said, before Hermione elbowed him with a channeled silencer.

"Alastor," Professor McGonagall cut in. "What have I told you about casting spells at students?"

"That it's not an appropriate teaching method," Moody replied. "But they've got to know what's out there. They've got to be ready. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!" He suddenly shouted, making everyone jump. "And Albus agrees. Besides," he added with a grin at Elysia, "Miss Potter here got the jump on me. Twenty points, lass. What was that, anyway?"

"A wide-area stunner," Elysia shrugged.

"'Boom' isn't the incantation for any stunner _I_ know of, lass," Moody said.

"Who said that was the incantation?" Elysia smirked. "If I yell 'boom,' are you going to hear me mutter _stupefacio locus_ right after?"

Hermione snorted.

"Another five points, Miss Potter, that's clever thinking. Now let me up so we can get on with the lesson."




+++++



Professor McGonagall decided to stay and observe the class. Once the students had retaken their seats, Professor Moody pulled out a jar of spiders, causing Ron to wince.

"Now then," Moody said, "you lot have had quite the dog's breakfast for instruction in this class, and I've only got the one year to fix what I can. As such," he growled, "best start thinking of this class as Junior Auror boot camp. The headmaster has given me quite a bit of leeway in order to bring you all up to scratch, and that includes showing you some of what a dark wizard is capable of. Which brings us to today's lesson: the Unforgivable Curses."

Professor McGonagall narrowed her eyes.

"Who can tell me the name of one of these curses?" Moody continued.

Ron raised his hand, Hermione's silencing spell long since dispelled. "The Imperius?"

Moody nodded at him. "Aye, that'd be one. Five points. Weasley, right? Your da would know all about that one, lad. Gave the Ministry no end of trouble during the war." He stunned a spider from the jar, laying it on his desk. "Needs to be a bit bigger so you lot can all see. _Engorgio!_"

The spider grew to the size of a small dog, causing Ron to whimper.

"The Imperius curse allows the caster to completely control the target," Moody lectured. "Like so. _Imperio!_"

There was no visible glow of spell-fire. There was no visible indication at all (aside from the HUD in Elysia's glasses, which were still on active-scan mode), until the spider began to tap-dance around the desk. Many of the class laughed at its antics, until Moody continued.

"Think it's funny, do you? What if I made it bite one of you?" He glowered. "Imagine this cast on your mother. I could make her kill her entire family and then herself. I could make her wander into the Ministry and assassinate people. I could make her wander out into Muggle London and blow the Statute of Secrecy wide open." The class sobered immediately.

"I think you lot get the idea," Moody said. "Anyone else thought of another yet?"

Neville raised a hand.

"You'd be Longbottom?"

Neville nodded.

"Go ahead, lad."

Neville flinched. "Th-the Cruciatus curse," He stuttered.

Moody's mundane eye softened. "Brave lad, bringing that one up. Pain beyond the tolerance of the mortal mind. Five points to you. Brace yourselves, class. _Crucio!_"

An angry blood-orange beam flew from his wand. The spider rolled onto its back atop the desk, all eight legs flailing in a grotesque mockery of its earlier dance. A high keening could be heard, which was surprising -- Elysia hadn't thought spiders _could_ scream.

Elysia glanced at Neville as Moody let up on the curse, and saw tears streaking his face. She reached over and squeezed his hand consolingly.

"Sorry, lad," Moody said. "But you've got to know. Now, one left. Anyone? Miss Granger?"

Hermione put her hand down and said quietly, "the killing curse."

"Aye, lass. Five points. The killing curse means instant death. Only one person has ever survived it, so the rumor goes. Personally, I think that's rubbish and something else happened that Samhain night, but good luck convincing Albus of anything once he's made his mind up. Anyway. _Avada kedavra!_"

A sinister green bolt of spell-fire hit the spider, which curled up dead. Elysia felt as if a great, intangible _something_ had passed before her, and the weight of it chilled her to the core.

"Now," Moody said, breaking the shaken reverie of the students. "Who can tell me _why_ these spells are considered Unforgivable? You can kill someone with a simple cutting curse, cause pain with a well-placed boil hex, and control someone with judicious use of Confundus charms. What makes these three so special?"

"'Cuz using one's a one-way ticket to Azkaban," Seamus volunteered.

"Wrong, lad," Moody retorted. "You've got your cause and effect backwards. And for the record, it's only illegal to cast them on _humans._ Spiders, for instance, are fair game."

"Because you have to _mean_ them," Elysia said.

"There, that's it!" Moody enthused. "Five more points, Miss Potter. You have to mean them. I'd wager any one of you lot could throw a killing curse at me right now and I wouldn't get so much as a nosebleed. To properly cast the Unforgivables, you have to _want_ to destroy someone, with all your will. Some argue that there may be benevolent uses for these curses -- mercy killings, teaching muscle memory via Imperius, restarting a stalled heart via Cruciatus. Rubbish, I say. Not with the emotions that power them."

"You must hate spiders even more than Ron does," Seamus joked weakly. Dean reached over and smacked him upside the head.

"Back during the war," Moody continued, ignoring Seamus' outburst, "the Ministry granted special dispensation for aurors to cast the Unforgivables. Why was this a bad idea?"

Hermione raised her hand. "Because the kind of people who can effectively use the Unforgivables make for questionable officers of the law, at best."

"Dead on, Miss Granger, take five more points. The auror corps was desperate back then, but even so. There was a marked decline after the war in the quality of auror you saw in the corps. 'Course, that could've just been down to my retiring," he joked.

Professor McGonagall snorted, reminding them all of her presence.

"Thank you, Alastor, for that enlightening lesson," she said. "I believe I shall take my leave."



+++++



After class, Moody led a still-shaken Neville to his office with promises of a book on exotic plants to help soothe his nerves. The others headed back to the Great Hall for dinner.

"Why'd you lie earlier, Ellie?" Ron asked.

Elysia shot him a look and quickly cast a privacy paling around them. "You mean about being from Canada?" Ron nodded. "Same reason I changed my eye color and hid my scar. I'm bloody sick of being singled out over that bloody 'Boy-Who-Lived' shite."

"Girl-Who-Lived now, I reckon," Ron said.

"Whatever," Elysia retorted. "And besides, every DADA professor so far has tried to kill me. Even Professor Lupin last year, when he forgot his Wolfsbane. I just plain don't trust Moody. And why would _you?_ Didn't he turn you into a weasel?"

Hermione giggled.

Ron glared. "I'm never going to live that down, am I?"

Elysia and Hermione locked eyes, looked back at Ron, and shook their heads, grinning.

Ron just stalked away, grumbling.



+++++



After her spur-of-the-moment lie to Moody, Elysia decided she should shore up her story just in case. So that weekend she dropped into her library in Elysium to do some reading.

> To Do:
>
> - [x] Read up on Canada and get the story straight
> - [x] Find and read Magician, Heal Thyself
> - [x] Find and read Rock Out and Rule the Dance Floor

In the end, she decided that her cover identity was from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, born to a pair of Muggle-born curse-breakers named David and Amelíe, and home-schooled once she was old enough to accompany her parents on expeditions. As luck would have it, snowy owls (ie. Hedwig) just so happened to be native to that area. She'd just have to avoid calling her familiar by name for awhile.

Given how intense DADA had been so far this year, she also decided to learn some healing magic. Even though she could shift most of her own injuries away, there was always a chance something could get through. Not to mention, this way she could take care of her friends.

And finally, since Hermione's birthday party was fast approaching, she decided it was high time she learned to dance. She wiggled happily in her seat in anticipation.



+++++



Later that day, Elysia was leaving the loo to rejoin Luna and Hermione in the library when a voice called out, "Harry! A word, please!" She ignored it and kept walking, but the voice called out again, "Mr. Potter! A word, if you please!" She recognized that voice. It was Dumbledore. And the irritating old goat was dead-naming her! Not even breaking stride, she continued ignoring him.

Then a hand on her shoulder stopped her and spun her around to face the headmaster. "Harry! I'm talking to you!"

"You must have me confused for someone else, sir," Elysia said stiffly. "My name is _Elysia,_ not Harry. Nor am I a 'mister.'"

"Come now, Harry," Dumbledore said, eyes twinkling in such a way that Elysia was tempted to lock eyes and shift in a basilisk stare. "We both know there are no other Potters."

Elysia's glare sharpened to a knife-edge. "You are mistaken, _sir,_" she bit out. "I'm from _Canada._ There are _tons_ of Potters out there, especially in the mundane world. I'd've expected the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW, of all people, to know that. And _furthermore,_ do I _look_ like your silly little Golden Boy? Last I heard, _he_ had green eyes and a great big scar on his forehead. I have neither. Not to mention, _I'm a girl._"

"Glamour charms," Dumbledore said dismissively.

"Go ahead then," Elysia challenged, eyes blazing. "_Finite_ them, if you're so certain."

Dumbledore drew his wand and waved it, intoning a firm, "_finite incantatem,_" and was utterly perplexed when nothing happened.

"Satisfied?" Elysia growled. "Good. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a letter to write to my parents. If this is how you treat your students, then I might just go back to home-schooling, no matter how boring things are with my parents not on expedition."

She spun on her heels and stalked off, leaving a bewildered Dumbledore in her wake.
