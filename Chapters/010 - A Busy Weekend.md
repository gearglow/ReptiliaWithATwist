## Chapter 10: A Busy Weekend

The next morning, so early the sun hadn't yet crested the horizon, Elysia woke with a jolt. She'd been having such a compelling dream, but it was fading so fast... and it was gone. Damn.

She rolled over and tried to go back to sleep, to no avail. Eventually, she dropped into Elysium to start her morning routine with a check of the List and a chat with her parents.

Coming back to the real world, she found Hermione was just waking up.

"Still want to join me and Robbie for our workout, 'Mione?'" She asked.

"It's 'Robbie and I,'" Hermione corrected with a yawn.

"Aha, so you *are* awake!" Elysia crowed.

Hermione threw a pillow at her. "Alright, fine," she grumbled, fighting off another yawn.

The two finished their morning ablutions and joined Robbie by the lake for a run. After a few laps, they returned to the dorms, where, since it was still quite early on a Saturday morning, the other girls snored away quietly.

Elysia opened her trunk and started down the stairs, only to look up at Hermione's gasp. She grinned at Hermione's astonished expression, and beckoned her to follow.

Hermione's eyes were wide as Elysia gave her the grand tour of the little flat she shared with Robbie. She made sure to end the tour in the locus room, because as soon as Hermione set foot inside she was off, examining every little thing and chattering a mile a minute. Elysia leaned against the doorjamb, a fond smile on her face as she watched her best friend's excitement.

Hermione trailed off as she noticed Elysia's expression. "What?" She asked, hiding bashfully behind her hair.

"You know I literally wrote that rune schema in like four hours, right?" Elysia said, grin widening.

"Oh, um, right," Hermione said sheepishly. "I forgot you wrote it."

"I must say, Miss Granger, I'm flattered by your enthusiasm for my work," Elysia said in a faux-posh accent.

"Well, Miss Potter," Hermione retorted, playing along. "Your work _does_ show remarkable sensibilities, especially given the constraints under which it was performed."

"Why thank you."

"Certainly."

They laughed, and headed out to finish their workout.



-----



By the time they were done, breakfast was well underway. The two reached the Great Hall just as Luna came down the stairs.

"Good morning," she said with a happy-sounding, adorably squeaky yawn.

Elysia and Hermione caught each other's eyes and, over passive legilimency, at the exact same time, sent the exact same thought: _oh no, she's so cute!_

"Good morning, Luna," they chorused back.

"Are you ready for the Arithmancy and Runes exams?" Elysia continued.

"Certainly," Luna replied. "I expect it will be nice to feel challenged in my classes finally. And you, Ellie?"

Elysia grinned. "Definitely. Gotta keep Hermione on her toes, after all. I've been slacking too much. Divination, honestly. What on earth was I thinking?"

"Probably that it was an easy O, if I recall," Hermione said mock-primly. Luna giggled.

"You'd think I'd know better than to let myself get bored by now," Elysia grinned. "That way lies mischief."

Hermione snorted. "Mischief's in your blood, Ellie. I'm just glad you're not a prankster like your father and his marauders, or the twins. The castle would come down around our ears."

Elysia winked at Luna. "No worries there. Can't have poor Professor McGonagall's pretty black hair going grey, now can we?"




-----



After breakfast, both Elysia and Luna followed Professor McGonagall (and her 'pretty black hair,' as always done up in a severe bun) to their Arithmancy qualifier, which was mostly - but not entirely - theory at this level. They broke for lunch, chatting with Hermione about it while Ron eyed them all askance.

"Still say you're mental, Ellie," he muttered around a mouthful of roast beef.

"Ron, d'you know what you can _do_ with Arithmancy?" Elysia retorted. "I just watched Luna modify Professor Vector's spell _in flight._ Granted, it was just a paintball spell, and she only changed the color, but _still._ It was one of the coolest things I've ever seen!" She grinned at Luna, who beamed back.

"You monkey-patched a spell _in flight,_ Luna?" Hermione squealed. "That's incredible! I've read that's a top-tier dueling technique! It's incredibly tricky."

Luna flushed under the effusive praise. "I suppose it is," she replied. "Professor Flitwick can do it. It's something my mother was known for, too, back when she was a professional duelist. She was Professor Flitwick's protégé before she retired to have me and became a spell-crafter."

Ron, who thankfully had swallowed his food first, gaped.

"Of course," Luna continued, "it's not very practical. You need lightning reflexes to manage even the simplest of spells. But it does look rather impressive, doesn't it?" She grinned.

"I'll say," Elysia gushed.



-----



After lunch was the Runes qualifier, which both girls completed in record time. Professor Babbling looked like Yule had come early.

"Between you two and Miss Granger, I might actually get to hold an accellerated study track this year," she gushed. "It'd be a shame to hold so many brilliant minds back, now that there are enough of you to make a case for it."

Hermione was ecstatic when Luna told her at dinner. "Do you think we'll be able to learn about warding and curse-breaking?"

"Perhaps a bit," Luna replied. "Those _are_ rather advanced topics, after all."

"I can't wait," Elysia grinned.

None of them noticed the speculative look one Albus Dumbledore was giving them from the staff table.

The next morning, after their usual training routine, Elysia and Hermione sat across from each other on the mat. Today they were going to try bringing Hermione into Elysium.

"Are you sure this will work, Ellie?" Hermione asked nervously.

"I'm like 99% sure," Elysia replied with a grin. "Your passive linking is solid, and your active linking is loud and clear. It's just like diving into a memory, yeah? You've done that before."

"I know," Hermione pouted. "You know how I get, though."

"All up in your head?" Elysia snorted. "Hermione. You'll be in _my_ head. I'll be right there with you every step of the way."

Hermione took a deep breath and puffed it out. "Okay. Let's do this. _Legilimens._"

Just like with Snape, Elysia caught Hermione's mental probe and gave it a solid tug, and they both appeared in the dueling ring outside the cottage in Elysium.

Hermione gasped as she looked around. "Oh, Ellie, it's so pretty!"

Elysia giggled. "Wait 'til you see the inside. C'mon, I'll introduce you to my parents." She led the way into the cottage, Hermione gazing all around in wonder.

Lily and James were waiting for them in the sunken living room. 

"So this is the 'best friend' I've heard so much about! A pleasure, milady," James said, bowing with excessive flourish. 

Lily smacked him upside the head. "Hello, Hermione. It's nice to meet you."

Hermione smiled. "Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Potter."

"Hey now, none of that 'Mr.' stuff," James said. "I didn't die this young just to be addressed like my father. Call me James."

"Not Prongs?" Hermione asked in a deceptively innocent tone. "How do you feel about 'Bambi?'"

Elysia and Lily snickered as James face-palmed.

"I _like_ this one!" Lily exclaimed, pulling Hermione into a one-armed hug.

"Me too," Elysia winked at Hermione. "I think I'll keep her."

Hermione bit her lip, clearly holding back a comment of some sort, causing both Elysia and Lily to grin even wider.

"Somebody's a bad influence!" Lily sang.

"How about you give me the tour, Ellie?" Hermione said with a huff.

Elysia grabbed her hand and they were off. Hermione was confused by the workshop, given that Elysium was a mindscape, but Elysia just said "prototyping and simulations," and that explained it all as far as Hermione was concerned. Finally, the tour ended in the study, where Janet met them.

"Hi, I'm Janet!" She greeted Hermione cheerfully.

Hermione's eyes were as big around as Slytherin's basilisk at the sight of the bookshelves. Elysia elbowed her. "Oh! Um, hello, Janet," she stammered.

"Hello, Hermione," Janet replied, smiling.

"Janet's basically the embodiment of all knowledge in the universe," Elysia told Hermione casually.

Hermione's eyes bugged out.

"I'm not _that_ Janet, though," Janet said. "I'm just the embodiment of all knowledge in Elysia's head."

"Close enough," Elysia said. Grinning, she grabbed Hermione's hand again before the bushy-haired bookworm could dive into the stacks. "Woah, there. Don't overdo it or you'll be bored to tears all year!"

Janet handed Hermione a book, with a list tucked into the cover page. "Here, start with these for today. You should read that last one too, Elysia," she continued, handing her another book.

> - Hogwarts' Hidden History: What Hermione's Favorite Book Won't Tell You

Smiling fondly as Hermione settled into one of the armchairs by the window and began devouring the book, Elysia settled in and devoured her own. Something suddenly struck her as she finished, and she went over to the desk.

"_Morgana's rack,_" she breathed. "Janet? Does this mean what I think it means?"

Janet came over. "If you think it means that Moldy Voldy keeps shooting himself in the foot, you're dead on."

Just then, they were interrupted by a shrieking Hermione. "_WHAT!?_ You mean this one _stupid_ ward is setting back Muggle-Magical relations by _centuries_ all because wizards were too lazy to put up an actual lightning rod!?" She devolved into incoherent shrieks of fury.

"Um, 'Mione?" Elysia said, putting a calming hand on her shoulder. "You know we can fix it, right?"

Hermione took a deep, gasping breath and held it for a 5-count, letting it all out in a sigh. "I know, Ellie. It's just, how are magicals so constantly lacking in common sense? 'Too much magic' indeed. And that single anti-lightning ward prevents entire _classes_ of magic from even being _discovered,_ much less _taught,_ and it just makes me so mad I could scream!"

"Honestly, Hermione? Scream. Go off. And when you're done, we'll see who wants to go on a little adventure to fix it. Because everything else aside, I _really_ want to have movie nights sometime."

Hermione took a deep breath, stood, and let out an ear-splitting roar of utter fury. 

"Feel better?"

"Much," Hermione replied, panting.



-----



After cleaning up, the pair made their way down to breakfast, again meeting Luna at the entrance to the Great Hall.

"Good morning, you two," Luna greeted them with another adorably-squeaky yawn.

"Good morning, Luna," they chorused, grinning.

Luna stared at them for a moment. "Do you two practice doing that?"

Elysia and Hermione looked at each other. "Doing what?"

Luna cocked an eyebrow. "And people call _me_ loony," she muttered under her breath, fighting a giggle.

"So, Luna," Elysia said. "O Magnificent Mistress of the Monkey-Patch. Wanna go on an adventure with us?"

"Ooh, yes please!" Luna replied, bouncing on her feet happily.

"Breakfast first, you two," Hermione said. "We'll tell you all about it while we eat."

They found empty seats across from Ron, Ginny, and Neville, who were also invited.

"So what's this about, then?" Neville asked.

"Well," Elysia started, "You know how Hogwarts: A History says that muggle electronics won't work at Hogwarts because there's too much magic?"

Hermione let out a snort of fury as the others nodded. "It turns out," she growled, "that the original edition where that's brought up said that magicals _rely too much on magic,_ not that there's too much ambient magic. Someone set up an anti-lightning ward, centuries ago, and it stops electrical circuits from working entirely. So stupid! All they had to do was transfigure a big metal stick on top of the highest tower, and run a grounding wire. But no, they put in an overly-broad ward and now whole _classes_ of magic don't work here!"

Ron and Neville gaped as she continued to rant. Ginny barely refrained from giggling.

Luna placed a calming hand on her shoulder. "We'll fix it, Hermione," she soothed.

"Heck yeah, we will!" Elysia crowed. "And then we can have movie nights!"

"What's a 'movie?'" Ron asked.

Elysia and Hermione looked at each other and grinned.

### Hogwarts Grounds, Scotland	1994/09/04 09:15

They decided to put up the lightning rod first, as a fail-over precaution. When the ward came down, there was a chance of built-up energy discharging, and having somewhere to discharge _to_ was probably a good idea.

First, they all congregated on the grounds. Elysia, Ron, and Ginny had their brooms with them. Hermione instructed them to gather a bunch of rocks, the redder the better (presumably because of iron content), so they all trooped over to the lake shore and made a pile of stones. Then Hermione waved her wand over it, turning it first into one big rock, then into a lump of metal, then drawing out the metal into a tall pole and a large metal spike, joined by a long coil of large-gauge cable.

"We should probably shield the cable..." Elysia mused, which led to them all gathering sticks and leaves. Hermione transfigured them into a sheet of rubber, then charmed the rubber into place around the cable. By the time she was done, Elysia had transfigured another stone into a metal plate, which was then transfigured into a junction box and connected to the cable. Luna then started carving runes of permanence into the transfigured materials, so they would keep their new form.

About an hour after they'd started, they had one complete lightning rod ready for installation. The three with brooms flew up to the top of the tallest tower, levitating the rod and stabilizing the cable as they went. The cable spooled out below them, as Neville, Luna, and Hermione kept control of the stake-end. Once the rod portion was standing up straight atop the tower's spire, Elysia transfigured the end of the rod to cap the spire snugly, and sealed it in place with permanent sticking runes. The three fliers then flew down the cable, using sticking charms and runes to affix the cable to the side of the tower, until they landed and Elysia drove the anchor stake deep into the ground with a powerful banishing charm. A few notice-me-not runes, and then they all stood back to admire their work.

"Wow, that looks rather good!" Neville said.

"And the wrackspurts are keeping away, too," Luna added.

"How about gremlins?" Hermione asked.

"I haven't noticed any of them either," Luna replied, "but as they feed on electricity they tend to avoid Hogwarts anyway."

"Well that's lucky," Ron said. "Come on, it's time for lunch and I'm _starving!_"

"My brother, the walking stomach," Ginny lamented.

### Room of Requirement, Hogwarts	1994/09/04 13:08

"Sufh wushf bha phlam?" Ron said around a mouthful of food (again).

"Step one: swallow your food before talking!" Hermione snapped with a glare. "Honestly, Ronald."

Ron swallowed with what looked like quite a bit of effort. "What's step two, then?"

Ginny face-palmed.

"Not here," Elysia said. "After we eat, we'll go somewhere to plan. In retrospect, this might take more time than we have left this weekend."

The others agreed, and after lunch Elysia led them to a corridor on the seventh floor, stopping to pace in front of a tapestry of dancing trolls.

_I need a place to plan an excursion to the Hogwarts Wardstone Chamber,_ she thought intently.

When they all filed into the Room, they found something out of a spy movie, with the highlights being a large conference table holding a live scale model of what appeared to be maintenance access tunnels, a workbench with rune-carving supplies, and shelves full of reference books. There were also several blackboards on wheeled stands scattered about.

"What _is_ this place?" Neville asked, looking around in wonder.

"It's the Room of Requirement, or as we elves call it, the Come-And-Go Room," Robbie said, appearing already seated at the model-bearing table with a quiet pop. "It turns into whatever you need it to be."

Neville looked at the model, looked at Robbie, and asked, "What if we need it to be a door straight to the Wardstone Chamber?"

Everyone else looked at each other for a moment, and the sound of six palms impacting upon six foreheads echoed through the room.

Elysia focused for a moment, and the model-laden table was replaced by a scale-model of the Hogwarts Wardstone Chamber[^2]. It was more of a cavern, really, and full of haphazard columns of an unidentifiable crystal, all of which were glowing softly in a rainbow of colors. Interspersed amongst them were shorter, stouter crystals of a deeper blue, as if they were made from deep ocean water made solid. All were carved over every visible inch with runes, all too small to make out at this scale. Two clusters of runes, on separate crystals, were glowing red.

"Goodness," Luna gasped.

"What are those red areas?" Hermione asked.

"I asked the room to show us where the lightning ward runes were," Elysia answered, "and also where the curse on the DADA position was, if it was there."

"Good thinking," Hermione replied with a smile. "Can you ask it to show us those specific clusters up close too?"

Elysia gestured to the blackboards lining the room, and two of them filled with annotated rune schema diagrams.

Luna had wandered over to a door which had appeared next to the original door, and cracked it open. "Oh my," she gasped. "Um, Ellie? 'Mione? You might want to take a look at this."

Hermione peered through the now wide-open door.

"Morgana's left nut," Hermione gasped.

Elysia snorted. Luna started giggling hysterically.

"These crystals are gargantuan!" Hermione exclaimed when she recovered. "Even the small ones are the size of a house! And those columns must be nearly a kilometer high!"

The others ambled over to peek through the doorway, and stared in awe.

"Bloody hell!" Ron said.

"That model really doesn't do the real thing justice," Neville commented.

"We're gonna need more brooms," Ginny said.

Elysia grinned. "Maybe not. I've got a new spell to show you all."

Hermione, of course, had already picked up the Unlimited Flight spell from reading __Magical Mobility: From Apparition to Zero-Gravity__ in Elysium. So while Elysia taught the others how to fly unassisted, she started going over the rune schema diagrams on the blackboards. After a bit, Luna joined her.

"So this is the infamous curse on the DADA position," she murmured.

Hermione nodded. "It's hard to imagine just how much trouble this devious little cluster has caused, isn't it? Even in just the few years I've been at Hogwarts: First year, possessed by Voldemort, dead before the Leaving Feast. Second year, obliviated straight into the Janus Thickey ward. Last year, run out of the castle for being a werewolf. It makes one wonder what's in store for Professor Moody this year, doesn't it?"

"Nothing good, I'm sure," Luna said. "Even if we _do_ break the curse, I think it's already been set in motion for this year."

"So what do you think," Elysia said, coming up behind them. "Just erase both clusters and call it good?"

"Can you do that?" Luna queried.

"_Kendu akatsa,_ right?" Hermione said. "Now I know why you said I should learn Aquitanian."

"Huh?" Luna said.

"The Potters have Basque roots," Elysia explained. "Over the summer I went through the Potter vaults, and found a bunch of old grimoires in Aquitanian. One of them had a bunch of spells to help with runes and sigils and such. Apparently the Potters were known for warding and enchanting at one point. Soul magic too, it turns out, because of golem-crafting, though those spells aren't all that useful most of the time. Anyway, _kendu akatsa_ got translated to modern Euskara, and means roughly 'remove the blemish.' It's used for un-etching."

Luna made puppy-eyes. "Ooh! Can you teach me? Pretty _pretty_ please?"

Elysia blushed. "Um. And people say _I'm_ dangerous?"

Hermione snickered.

"Hey!" Elysia grumbled. "_You_ try resisting Luna's puppy-eyes and see how _you_ like it!" She turned back to Luna. "Of course I'll teach you. I was planning to anyway. Should come in handy for class, too."

"Yay!" Luna bounced up and down happily.

Elysia smiled fondly, and caught Hermione smiling too.

"So, back to the question at hand," Elysia continued. "Can we just erase them, or is it more complicated than that?"

"Well," Hermione started. "The lightning ward, I think we can just erase. The DADA curse, on the other hand..."

"Yes," Luna chimed in. "That one's a nasty piece of work. I'm not even sure what half these runes _are,_ much less what they do in concert."

"I say we flag it and come back to it later, then," Elysia said. "Like you said, it's already in effect for the year, so we've got time to figure it out before the next victim."

Ron, Ginny, and Neville, done practicing the flight spell, drifted over.

"So what's the plan?" Neville asked.

"The DADA curse is too complex to tackle today," Hermione answered, "but the lightning ward we think can just be erased. So I think we're just going to find both clusters, wipe the lightning ward cluster, and mark the DADA curse cluster so we can find it more easily when we're better prepared."

"Wait a minute," Ron interjected. "These are the _Hogwarts Wardstones._ Are we _sure_ we can just go in and muck about with them? Something like that, I'd expect at least _some_ protection."

Elysia stuck her head through the door, mage-sight and glasses active. 

"What're you doing, Ellie?" Luna asked.

"Thaumic analysis," Elysia answered absently, squinting at the shadowed edges of the cavern. "I picked up some new glasses over the summer, and they've got some neat little tricks built in." She neglected to mention that _she_ was the one who'd built those tricks into the glasses in the first place.

"Wait, what?" Hermione exclaimed. "And you didn't tell me? Rude!" She stuck out her tongue at Elysia, who stuck hers out right back. All three of them giggled.

"Anyway," Elysia said. "I don't see any wards active in the cavern proper, at least not from here. I'd wager that most of the protections are on the ways in and out, and since the Room of Requirement seems to have bypassed those, we should be in the clear. I'd expect the headmaster to notice when the wards change, though, so we'll have to be quick. Mark the DADA curse first."

"I should probably stay here and make sure the way back doesn't disappear on you," Neville said.

"Good idea, Nev," Elysia said. "Hadn't thought of that."

On a hunch, Elysia asked the Room to highlight any other problems with the wards. Several more clusters turned red. "Bollocks," she muttered. Several more blackboards filled with diagrams.

"What happened?" Ginny asked.

"I asked the Room if there was anything else wrong with the wards. Turns out there is."

Hermione looked over at the blackboards. "Bollocks."

"So we do the same thing with those as we do for the DADA curse," Luna said. "Maybe we can show them to Professor Babbling as an extra credit project."

"Bill might be able to help too," Ginny added. "He _is_ a curse-breaker, after all."

Elysia wandered over to the worktable and started carving a simple schema for a glowing red arrow illusion into some sandstone. "Here, everyone copy this and we'll stick them to the problem clusters."

Everyone else started copying the arrow stones, and Elysia grabbed some chalk and started labeling each cluster on the blackboards.

"Anyone know a good locator spell?" She asked.

Everyone looked at each other. "Try asking the Room?" Neville eventually suggested.

Elysia did so, and a ghostly image formed over the table demonstrating a spell and repeating the words _monstrant viam._

"_Monstrant viam,_" she repeated, copying the wand movements and focusing on the blackboard with the lightning ward diagram. A softly-glowing trail of cyan light began at her feet and led to the blackboard.

"Ooh, that's _perfect!_" Luna squealed, eyes shining.

"Wonder if it'll work on the twins?" Ginny mused, smirking.

"I'll let you be the one to test that," Ron said. "Anyway, the arrows are done."

"Let's get to it, then," Elysia said. "Nev, Robbie, thanks for watching our backs."

Neville and Robbie took a seat at the table. The others lined up just beyond the door to the Wardstone Chamber, raised their wands in unison, and said, "_hegan egin mugarik gabe!_"

As they all rose into the air, whooping with delight, five trails of light streaked off into the cavern. Hermione headed for the lightning ward, Elysia took on the DADA curse, and the others busied themselves with the other 'clusters of concern,' as they'd been dubbed.

The DADA cluster proved to be on one of the shorter crystals, and as Elysia drew near her HUD lit up with field lines. As the analytics HUD started identifying them, she swore softly. "Hey, you lot!" She called out. "There's localized trap wards on this cluster! Fall back to the Room!" She did a cursory field trace, making note of the points of origin for the traps, and found they were buried in the cave floor.

"_Ventus,_" she muttered, clearing them off. She stared intently for a moment, memorizing them. She'd be able to break them down later in Elysium's workshop. Then she dropped her arrow to mark the field's edge and rejoined the others back in the Room.

"I managed to get the lightning ward, at least," Hermione reported.

"Wonderful!" Elysia crowed. "Now I can show you a nifty little spell I found in a travelogue from Hawai'i. It used to be used for fishing, and now apparently they use it on tourists who get too handsy. Room, if you would?"

The lights dimmed, and a metal pole rose from the floor, roughly as tall as Elysia. She raised her wand and jabbed it forward, intoning, "_limahana!_" A spark jolted from her wand with an audible crackle, arcing from the tip of her wand to the metal pole. She held it for a few seconds, the electric glow casting dancing shadows.

As she released the spell, the lights came back up and the pole retreated back into the floor.

"Bloody brilliant," Ron said.
