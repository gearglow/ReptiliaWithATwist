## Chapter 8: The New Girl

The remainder of the summer passed quickly. Percy and Mr. Weasley were at the Ministry more often than not, dealing with the aftermath of the World Cup and the Death Eaters, not to mention that mystery event everyone kept hinting at.

Much to the delight of everyone, Lucius Malfoy had indeed been one of those petrified in full Death Eater regalia. He, along with the rest of those captured, were sentenced to a minimum of a year in Azkaban for muggle-baiting and causing an international incident, among other things -- they all were raided by the DMLE for cause, as well, leading Malfoy, at least, to a longer sentence.

"Couldn't happen to a nicer bloke," Ron said when he heard.

"Wonder how Draco's going to handle it," Elysia mused. "I imagine either he'll be keeping his head down or he'll be on a hair-trigger."

The other big thing that happened occurred at dinner the day after they returned from the World Cup, after Hermione had relayed the relevant part of her conversation with Ginny from the other night.

"Hey, everyone? This summer's been an interesting one, and I've learned a lot about myself. And I need to share one of those things with you all." She took a deep breath. "I'm a girl. My name's Elysia now, or Ellie for short."

"Well *that* figures," Ginny said, then blushed deeply when she realized she'd said it out loud.

Ron looked conflicted, alternating between relief and worry. Elysia, noticing, grinned. "Steady on," she told him. "Still not into blokes."

Hermione got a thoughtful look on her face. "So what're you going to do about Hogwarts?"

Elysia hummed. "Good question. I suppose I should write Professor McGonagall again."

"Again?" Asked Fred. "And why --"

"-- would you be --" George continued.

"-- writing our esteemed professor --"

"-- over the summer?"

"Because I wanted out of Divination," Elysia answered. "She said I can test into Arithmancy and Runes, and if I do I can drop Divination."

"Well, we'll move you into Ginny's room with the other girls while you're here, dear," Mrs. Weasley said.

"Have you gone shopping for girl clothes yet?" Ginny asked.

"Some," Elysia shrugged. "I rather like the androgynous look, though. It gets some pretty great reactions."

Every single Weasley in the room except the adults blushed bright red at that. 

Hermione couldn't keep the smirk from her face. "It kind of says, 'I don't care what your sexuality is, you're definitely questioning it now.'"

Elysia raised an eyebrow at her, grinning. "Oh *really?*"

Hermione, despite her caramel complexion, blushed the brightest of them all.

Elysia wrote Professor McGonagall (and Sirius, while she was at it) as soon as dinner was finished. The next day, her answer came while Elysia and Hermione were sitting in the back garden, going over what Elysia would need for the Arithmancy and Runes qualifiers. The Weasleys gave them a wide berth; none of them wanted to spend the last few precious days of summer *studying.*

"There's a ritual for that?" Hermione asked.

"Apparently," Elysia said. "I'll just tell her yes. No need to tip my hand about the shifting just yet, though I think I might change my eyes to mess with people a bit. D'you think I should change my hair?"

"How do you mean?" Hermione asked.

In answer, Elysia shifted her still-short hair to auburn, then shifted some black streaks in, then shifted to black hair with bright red tips.

"Ooh, I like that last one," Hermione said. "It's quite striking."

Elysia shifted back. "I'll have to duck out for a day to give myself an alibi, then. Robbie can take me; that should reassure Mrs. Weasley."

"What are you going to *actually* do?" Hermione asked.

"Well, you *do* have a birthday coming up..."

### Hogwarts Express    1994/09/01  10:50

Despite Mr. Weasley being called into work for an emergency that morning, they still made it to Platform 9^3/4^ with 10 minutes to spare. As they made their way down the train, Fred and George broke off to sit with Lee Jordan and the chasers from the Gryffindor quidditch team. Elysia, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny continued on, finding that all of the compartments were full.

Finally, they came to one with only a single occupant: a girl with long, pale blonde hair and wide blue eyes, wearing Ravenclaw robes, who was reading a magazine upside-down.

"Hullo, Luna," Ginny said, opening the door. "May we join you?"

Luna looked up from the magazine she was reading. "Certainly," she replied in a dreamy voice.

"Everyone, this is Luna Lovegood. She's in my year," Ginny said, introducing them to Luna as they all filed in.

Elysia took the seat next to Luna, with Hermione on her other side and Ron and Ginny across from them.

"Whatcha reading?" She asked, leaning over.

Luna smiled absently. "The Quibbler. My father runs it."

"Neat," Elysia said. "Ooh, is that a rune puzzle?"

"So *that's* why it's upside-down," Hermione muttered under her breath.

"Yes," Luna said airily. Hermione looked abashed at being overheard. "Mother was a spell-crafter before she died, and she'd taught me Runes and Arithmancy ever since I was old enough to remember. Daddy runs the rune puzzles as a sort of memorial to her."

"I'm starting those subjects this year," Elysia said. "Professor McGonagall let me test into the 4^th^-year classes."

"Me too!" Luna exclaimed, pleased. "Well, I have yet to take the qualifying exams, of course, but I don't expect any problems."

"Same," Elysia said. "Hermione's made sure I haven't missed anything."

The three began discussing both Runes and Arithmancy with much enthusiasm. Ron and Ginny looked at each other in bemusement.

A few minutes later, Neville Longbottom joined them, taking the empty seat between Ron and Ginny. The discussion was already going so strongly, none of the other three even noticed at first, until Neville spoke up to say hello.

"Oh, hullo, Nev," Elysia said.

Neville blushed. "Do I know you -- *Harry!?*"

"It's Elysia now," she replied. 

"Oh," Neville said faintly.

"Hi, Neville," Hermione said, stifling a giggle. "How was your summer?"



+++++



A ride on the Hogwarts Express wasn't complete without Draco Malfoy stopping by to make a nuisance of himself.

"Potter!" He blustered, banging open the door to their compartment. "Um..."


Elysia stood, and stalked to the door. Draco gulped.

"Hello, *Draco,*" She growled. She ran a finger across his jaw, channeling a Jelly-Legs Jinx. He flushed as his knees gave out and he tumbled out into the hallway, knocking over Crabbe and Goyle. Elysia smirked, slammed the door shut, and locked it with several locking charms. "Goodbye, Draco!"

As she retook her seat, the compartment exploded in laughter.



+++++



The rest of the trip passed uneventfully, though pleasantly. Elysia's new-found confidence helped draw out the normally-shy Neville, and Luna found much in the way of common ground with both Elysia and Hermione. Her tendency to talk about creatures nobody else could see, or believed existed, notwithstanding, she easily kept pace with the two older girls intellectually.

Finally, they arrived at Hogsmeade Station and disembarked, with a wave to Hagrid which made the large man do a double-take. As the six of them approached the horseless carriages, Luna made a detour to the front of one, tugging Hermione's hand.

"Here, pet this," she said, placing Hermione's hand on *something.* Elysia raised an eyebrow. While she couldn't *see* anything, it was apparent that Hermione could *feel* something under her hand.

"Luna, I..." Hermione said. "I'm sorry I doubted you. What *are* they?"

"They're thestrals," Luna answered softly.

"I know about those!" Neville said. "You can only see them if you've seen someone die."

"Yes," Luna said wistfully. "They have a bad reputation because of that. But really they're quite gentle."

Elysia stepped closer to pet the thestral. Luna guided her hand to its flank. "It's kind of leathery, but soft," she told the others. 

Hermione had stepped back and was studying Luna. "Your mother?"

Luna nodded. "When I was nine. There was nothing I could do."

Hermione gently hugged the younger girl. "I'm sorry," she said softly.

They filed into the carriage after a last pat for the loyal thestral, and made their way up to the castle.



+++++



The storm that had been threatening all day finally broke on the way up from Hogsmeade, and despite the short dash from the carriages to the entry hall, they were all soaked to the skin by the time they made it indoors.

Just when they thought they were safe, water balloons began pelting them from above, soaking them once more -- not that Elysia felt it made much difference, really.

"PEEVES!" McGonagall yelled, dashing out of the great hall. 

After chasing off a cackling Peeves, the students were ushered into the Great Hall.

"Great, I'm soggy *and* starving," Ron grumbled. The others could only agree.

"Next time, _impervius_ charms on _everything,_" Elysia said.

Luna split off to the Ravenclaw table, and the others took seats midway down the Gryffindor table. Elysia scanned the staff table, noting that there were more empty seats than usual. One, she presumed, was Professor McGonagall's, and another was Hagrid's, as both were busy with the first-years. And then it clicked: the remaining empty seat was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

"Wonder who they got for DADA this year," she murmured to the others.

"Maybe they couldn't find anyone," Hermione said pensively.

"Maybe Peeves got them," Ron said. "Wish they'd hurry up with the sorting, I'm ravenous!"

Elysia scanned the staff table again, and caught the eye of Professor Snape. She'd seen plenty of people do double-takes over her this summer, but this was the first time she'd seen someone pale so drastically at the same time. *Looks like he's seen a ghost,* she thought to herself.

Professor McGonagall entered with the first-years, and as Hagrid took his seat the Sorting commenced. It was the first one since Elysia's own that she'd managed to see, as for the past two years something had always come up. Colin Creevy's little brother, Dennis, was sorted into Gryffindor, and Elysia giggled to herself as Colin tried to point out 'the famous Harry Potter' to him but didn't recognize her.

The Sorting wrapped up, and the feast appeared. Everyone dove in with relish, and Elysia pondered how it was that she could be so hungry after stuffing herself silly with snacks on the train ride.

Finally, dessert was devoured and the plates cleared. Dumbledore stood, and gave out his usual start-of-term notices. "It is my painful duty to inform you that there will be no Inter-House Quidditch Cup this year," he added, amid rising murmurs of shock and dismay from across the Hall, "due to an event starting this Halloween and continuing through the rest of the year. It is my great pleasure to announce that this year, Hogwarts --"

Several things happened at once, and Elysia couldn't help but admire the theatricality of it all. Thunder crashed, the doors to the Great Hall flew open, and a bolt of lightning flashed in the enchanted ceiling, illuminating a figure who looked as if he'd been born to the storm. His face was scarred, weathered, and craggy, with one piercing electric-blue eye, which rolled around independently of the other, which was a beady black and yet much more normal for that. He had a peg leg, shaggy hair the dark grey of storm-clouds, and a black traveling cloak billowing in the door's back-draft. All in all, Elysia thought even Snape would be hard-pressed to make a more dramatic entrance.

The figure made his way down the Hall to Professor Dumbledore, with whom he spoke quietly for a moment before taking the vacant DADA seat at the staff table.

"Allow me to introduce Retired Master Auror Alastor Moody," Professor Dumbledore said, "our new professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts."

The students' whispering among themselves reached a crescendo. Moody himself ignored them, and looked to be casting detection spells on his dinner. As Elysia watched, he took as swig from a hip flask.

"*Mad-Eye* Moody?" Ron said incredulously. "*That's* our new DADA professor?"

"The one your dad was called about this morning?" Hermione inquired.

Ron nodded. "That's him. He's supposed to be a legendary auror; caught more than his fair share of Death Eaters back in the war."

"As I was saying," Dumbledore continued, "Hogwarts will this year play host to the newly-reconstituted Tri-Wizard Tournament."

A chill of foreboding trickled down Elysia's spine.



+++++



The conversation was of the upcoming tournament as they all made their way to Gryffindor Tower. Ron and the twins were lamenting that they were too young, and discussing schemes to get around the Headmaster's Age Line.

"Better you than me, mate," Elysia said. "I'd rather a nice normal year for once."

Elysia almost followed Ron to the boys' dorms, but remembered at the last minute and turned to follow Hermione instead. *That's going to take some getting used to,* she thought to herself.

The girls' dorms were a mirror image to the boys' dorms. Hermione had the bed by the window, and Elysia's bed had been inserted between hers and Parvati Patil's.

"I was wondering whose bed that was," Parvati said. "Hello, new girl!"

Elysia grinned as she loosened her tie. "Hullo, Parvati. How was your summer?"

Parvati squinted at her. "How do you know my name -- wait a minute. *Harry!?*"

"It's Elysia now," she responded. "Or Ellie for short. Turns out that was a nickname of my mum's back in the day. Y'know, L. E.? Lily Evans?"

"Damn," Parvati said. "Right heart-breaker, you are. D'you have any idea how many girls are going to be disappointed that you've turned out to be one of us?"

Lavender Brown came in from the bathroom, took one look at Elysia, blushed furiously, and ducked back into the bathroom.

Elysia smirked. "Probably not that one?"

Hermione couldn't contain her giggles anymore. "That never gets old, Ellie!"

Elysia waggled her eyebrows at her, and over passive legilimency, sent, *especially when it's you getting flustered.*

Hermione's eyes widened and she squeaked, flushing deeply. "Um. I." Her brow furrowed and she squeezed her eyes shut, shaking her head. "Damn it, Ellie!"

Elysia laughed. "Language, 'Mione!"

Parvati giggled. "Woah, there, Heart-Breaker. You still need to sleep here, y'know."

Elysia favored her with a raised eyebrow. "What'd *I* do?"

Parvati crossed her arms and mock-glared. "You know what you did, young lady," she said sternly, waggling a finger. All three of them burst into giggles as Lavender braved joining them again, mock-pouting.

"It's just plain *unfair,*" she said, flopping down on the bed nearest the door. "You were so striking as a boy, and now you're *this* cute? The boys won't know what hit them."

"Ugh, do I give off straight vibes?" Elysia grumbled.

"Well, no, not so much I suppose," Lavender answered. "But you know how boys are."

"I guess," Elysia said. "Can't say they've ever made much sense to me."

"'Straight vibes?' Wait a minute..." Lavender said, then promptly blushed again.

"How *do* you flag for Sapphic-ness in the magical world?" Hermione mused. "In the muggle world there's things like accent nails and the handkerchief code."

"Short fingernails?" Lavender shrugged. They all blushed as the implications hit, avoiding each other's eyes.

"Dunno that anyone thinks enough of it to feel like they need to," Parvati mused, dragging the conversation to safer ground. "Signaling's a thing for muggles because of the controversy, right? But it's not controversial for us, so no need to be covert about things."

"It's more about how you behave and who you flirt with," Lavender added. "Though that tomboy look you've got is uncommon enough that you'll probably get lots of attention from everyone anyway. Even if you *did* change your eye color. How'd you do that, anyway?"

"Colored contacts," Elysia hummed. "Y'know, normally I don't like to stand out. But it's kind of fun when it's not because of that Boy-Who-Lived stuff, or because people are afraid of me, like when everyone thought I was the Heir of Slytherin. Hey, Lavender, Parvati?" She asked. "Can you not let everyone know about my transition? I want to enjoy their reactions while I can." She grinned mischievously.

"Sure thing, Heart-Breaker," Parvati said, grinning back. "This is gonna be *good.*"



### Hogwarts, Great Hall	1994/09/02	07:15

The next day was a Friday, and the first day of classes.

"History of Magic first thing? *And* double Potions? Great start to the year," Ron groused as Professor McGonagall passed out the schedules.

"At least we get a weekend right after," Elysia said, taking a seat at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione.

"Ellie? Where were you this morning?" Hermione asked, handing Elysia her schedule.

"Working out," Elysia answered as she filled her plate. In past years, she'd leaned towards the traditional pancakes, sausages, and other less-than-healthy breakfast foods, but this morning Hermione noticed a much more balanced selection. "Got into the habit over the summer. Especially with quidditch canceled this year, I need it to burn off the stress."

"What're *you* stressed about?" Ron asked. "It's barely the first day back!"

Elysia shrugged. "Nothing, yet. But you know how Hogwarts can be. And I've already got the habit; seems easier to just keep going with it."

"Mind if I join you, then, Ellie?" Hermione asked.

Elysia nodded, and was just about to reply, when -

"Good morning," Luna said from behind them.

Hermione jumped. "Luna!" She gasped. "Don't *do* that!"

Luna wrinkled her nose. "Say good morning?"

"No, not that," Hermione stammered. "I meant sneaking up on me."

"I'm sorry, Hermione, I didn't mean to," Luna said. "The wrackspurts do seem thicker than usual around here for this early in the term, so maybe that's why you didn't notice?"

"Maybe," Hermione agreed with a bemused smile. "Luna, what exactly *are* wrackspurts, anyway?"
