## Chapter 12: The Best Present

### Hogwarts, Deputy Headmistress' Office	1994/09/10 15:42

After her encounter with Dumbledore, a fuming Elysia immediately sought out her Head of House.

"What's got you so furious, Miss Potter?" Professor McGonagall asked.

"That -- that sanctimonious old _goat_ just deadnamed me!" Elysia growled. She then told Professor McGonagall all about how the headmaster had accosted her in the halls, and how she'd responded. "Muggle make-up and colored contacts, of course," she lied -- this particular lie was second-nature by now; she'd have to practice actually shifting or conjuring those surreptitiously, just in case -- "but the _nerve_ of that man! I've half a mind to fake my own death at this rate!"

Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared. "I quite agree, Miss Potter," she said. "Albus has always been prone to taking far more liberties than he ought, where you're concerned. Why, just look at how he left you with those horrible relatives of yours! Faking one's death is rather a drastic measure, but I do believe I can do something about your school records, at least." She sighed. "I hate to resort to gas-lighting, I really do, but he's clearly not about to listen to reason."

"Thank you, professor," Elysia said. "And I am sorry to have dragged you into such a prickly situation, but I just didn't know who else to turn to."

"Don't you worry about that, Miss Potter," Professor McGonagall admonished. "I'm your Head of House. You're _supposed_ to be able to come to me with your troubles."

### Hogwarts, DADA Classroom	1994/09/15 13:00

The rest of September was marked by three events in particular. The first was that, a week after Professor Moody demonstrated all three Unforgivables, he informed them that Headmaster Dumbledore had granted permission for them all to be put under the Imperius curse, "so you can know what it feels like," Moody said. He'd then had them all line up, and, one by one, made them do absurd and impossible things. Neville, for instance, had performed a flawless double back-flip off of Moody's desk.

Hermione, on the other hand, merely cocked an eyebrow, sat primly back in her seat, and smirked.

When it was Elysia's turn, Moody waved his wand and a feeling like floating in the _best bubble bath ever_ drifted over her mind for a moment, before fading away like morning fog.

"Jump on the desk," Moody commanded.

"Weren't you supposed to cast the spell first, Professor?" She responded, cocking one eyebrow.

"What? But I- _Imperio!_" He cast again.

The floating feeling swept over her again, disappearing just as quickly.

"Jump on the desk."

"Is there something wrong with your wand, Professor?" Elysia asked, feigning confusion.

"Let's find out, shall we, lass? Mr. Thomas! Front and center!"

Dean came up to the front of the class, whereupon Professor Moody made him pirouette _en pointe_ like a ballerina.

"Huh. Guess it's not the wand," Elysia observed, trying not to smirk.

"So it seems," Moody agreed. "Well done, lass! Ten points to Gryffindor. And five _from_ for your cheek."

### Room of Requirement, Hogwarts	1994/09/18 12:00	

The second marked event of September was Sunday the 18th, the day before Hermione's 15th birthday, and the day Elysia had organized for her birthday party. At noon, after a somewhat longer training session than usual, Elysia, Hermione, and Luna met all their friends in the entrance hall -- the Curse-Breaking 101 girls, the Weasleys, the Chasers, Neville, and the rest of the Gryffindor fourth-year girls, with whom Hermione's relationship had improved significantly after Elysia joined them. Parvati brought her sister Padma along as well.

They were all dressed casually for the day. Elysia had on a brick-red sundress with her Ironbelly-hide boots and jacket, and she'd taken the time to apply eyeliner and lip gloss. And judging from the glances both Hermione and Luna had been stealing, it was a good look on her.

Luna was in an airy floral-pattern dress with a pale blue cardigan, which had Elysia stealing a few glances herself. Hermione was the only one not wearing a dress; she'd donned figure-hugging jeans and a gauzy white blouse over a lime-green cami, which set off her darker complexion and kept causing the other girls to almost walk into things.

"Damn, Potter, you femme up nice!" Millicent Bulstrode said as they arrived.

"Thanks, Millie," Elysia said, giving her friend a once-over and biting her lip. Mille was in jeans, Doc Martens, a black vest tight enough to be painted on (and revealing washboard abs even through the fabric), and an open plaid button-up in Slytherin colors with the sleeves rolled up to show off her impressive biceps. "You look pretty damn good yourself."

"Hey there, Heart-Breaker," Parvati greeted her. "Save it for the party. Hullo, Hermione, and happy birthday!"

They all trooped up to the Room of Requirement, which Robbie had commandeered earlier. He was waiting for them in a twenty-something version of his human form, flopped on a sofa in what looked for all the world like a basement game room in a large muggle home. There were several table games -- ping-pong, foosball, billiards -- and a wet-bar along one wall covered in food and drinks. Another corner had a few arcade cabinets and a pinball table (titled, appropriately enough, _Pinball Wizard_). Along the back were more sofas, over-sized bean-bags, floor pillows, and a big-screen TV and VCR. There was a stereo behind the bar, and enough room to dance, errant billiard cues aside.

"Sweet Morgana!" Hermione gasped. "Is that _pepperoni pizza?_ Robbie, you've outdone yourself!"

"I also picked up a few movies," Robbie said, hopping up off the sofa. "_The Princess Bride, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Superman, Aladdin, The Goonies,_ a few Monty Python flicks..."

Hermione squealed, and bounded over to hug Robbie.

_Why the older look, bro?_ Elysia asked over their bond.

Robbie smirked. _It's closer to my actual age,_ he replied. _Besides, it makes it more awkward for any of your friends to hit on me._ 

_Oh right, good point. Sometimes I forget girls who like boys exist._

_Or the boys themselves, though aside from Ickle Ronnikins, bi disaster, I don't think it'd matter._

Elysia snorted at that.

_Besides,_ Robbie finished, _this way you can claim adult supervision._ "Alright, you lot," Robbie called out loud. "Presents first, then I'll show you pure-bloods what video games are."

Presents were a huge success. Most of them were books, of course; Hermione's reputation preceded her. But Luna had gotten her a set of exotic carving substrates and a top-tier rune-etching kit, which came in a moke-skin pouch and paired perfectly with the curse-breaker's goggles and linked runestone amulet from Elysia.

"It's got a bunch of settings built in: mage-sight augmentation, thaumic analysis, heat and X-ray vision..."

"Ooh!" Hermione's eyes gleamed.

"And the amulet -- I know it looks like a book-shaped locket," Elysia continued, "but if you open the latch and tap it with your wand, it grows into a bunch of pages of carving substrate. The first page is already linked to the goggles, too, so you can add functions. It's kind of like mine, but fancier." She held up her own amulet, which was a wire-wrapped crystal with tiny glowing runes carved into it. "And you should be able to add some of the substrates Luna gave you to it, too!"

Hermione immediately put on the goggles, sliding them up to her forehead so they held her hair back like an Alice band. She slipped the moke-skin pouch and the book-amulet on as well.

"Oh my," Luna murmured, blushing. "Don't you look dashing."

"You really do," Elysia agreed. She caught Luna's eyes. _Do I detect a crush, Luna?_

_Oh, hush, you. All three of us are crushing on each other and you know it._

Elysia mentally stuck her tongue out.

_You still haven't told me what you plan on doing with that, you know,_ Luna teased.

Elysia blushed, but gamely responded with, _wrestling yours into submission, maybe?_

Luna blushed again, and Hermione cut in with, _you two shameless flirts_ do _know that you're broadcasting, right? I heard every last word._ Hermione smirked. _Guess I'll take winner in your little wrestling match._ The other two girls' eyes widened and they flushed profusely. 

Someone had started music playing, and Robbie was currently showing the Weasley boys _Street Fighter II._ Everyone else seemed to be occupied with various games, or dancing, or talking in small groups.

"Right, you two, we clearly need to talk," Elysia muttered, dragging them over to an empty sofa and casting a privacy paling.

"Please don't make me choose," Luna said.

"Wasn't going to," Elysia said. "Janet told me about something called polyamory. We could just all date each other!"

"Like, oh, what's the word? A triad?" Hermione said from the middle, wrapping an arm around each other girl and pulling them in to snuggle.

"Yeah, that's the word! What do you both think?"

"Yes, please!" Luna said, snuggling closer and reaching for Elysia's hand over Hermione.

Elysia grabbed her hand and snuggled closer to Hermione as well. "Hermione?"

"Well," Hermione said. "I think it's obvious that I'm all for this. But it _will_ be a bit more complicated to make things work, I'm sure."

"But we will," Elysia said. "Think I might go a bit crazy if we didn't, quite honestly."

"Me too," Luna said.

"Me three," Hermione added. "Goodness! _Two_ girlfriends for my birthday? Best day ever."

Luna giggled. "We should try kissing. Like, all three of us at once."

They all leaned into a point between them and touched lips. It was gentle and silly and Elysia's heart fluttered fit to burst. Giggling, they all settled back into the sofa and Elysia dispelled the paling.

"You three finally make it official?"

Elysia sat up, looking around to find Millie flanked by Lisa and Megan, and all three grinning.

"Mm-hmm!" Luna nodded. Hermione wore a smugly contented smile.

"I must say," Lisa said, "you certainly moved faster on things than we did. Took us most of last year to sort ourselves out. You three have been inseparable all term!"

"What can I say?" Elysia grinned. "When you click, you click! And after the summer I had, I for one am not inclined to let fear or worry or _whatever_ get in the way of enjoying life."

"Well said," Hermione chimed in.



+++++



The rest of the party passed by in a happy blur of dancing, games, and conversation. Nobody was all that surprised by the new triad, aside from Ron, who had somehow missed that the three girls always came to breakfast together.

Finally, as dinner approached, they all settled down with food to watch _The Princess Bride._ The two oversized bean-bags were taken by the two triads, and everyone was smiling contentedly when the party finally ended.

### Gryffindor Common Room, Hogwarts	1994/09/24 16:11

The third notable event of the month was arguably less positive, though some good _did_ come of it in the end. One Saturday afternoon, near the end of the month, a bemused Neville clambered through the portrait.

"Alright, Nev?" Elysia asked.

"Hey, Ellie," he said, ambling over. "I suppose so, only..." He flopped down on the sofa with a huff. "The headmaster just called me into his office, out of nowhere, for a casual chat. I'm not sure what to make of it."

Elysia furrowed her brow. "That _is_ odd."

Janet's voice popped into her mind suddenly. "Oh that scheming little-! He's hedging his bets over the prophecy," she told Elysia. "The prophecy, I might remind you, which one Sybil Trelawney _made up_ in order to try to impress Dumbledore enough to be hired as Divination professor." She relayed the words of the so-called prophecy to Elysia, who looked at Neville with a calculating gaze before casting a dizzying array of subtle privacy palings.

She then proceeded to explain about the so-called prophecy, how it could have applied to either of them at the time, how it had affected her life, and finally, that Dumbledore was most likely trying to manipulate Neville into being a 'replacement Harry' because either 'Harry' had gone AWOL or the prophecy's pronouns no longer fit.

Neville snorted, surprising Elysia. "Joke's doubly on him, then. Serves the scheming old goat right. Y'see, I'm not a bloke either."

"Wait, _what?_ You - huh. Yeah, that actually makes a lot of things make sense." Elysia mused.

"Right?" Neville said. "I tried telling Gran once, _ages_ ago, but she keeps trying to mould me into some sort of replacement for my father. You'd think that his wand not working for me would've clued her in, but no." She sighed. "I envy you, getting to transition already. Gran would _never_ give permission for the ritual, so I'm stuck waiting until I come of age. I can't wait until I can finally be Nell and don't have to be Neville anymore."

Elysia tapped her chin in thought. "Hmm. Y'know, I _might_ be able to help you out... You'll need to learn some mind magic first, though."

"What, like occlumency?" Nell said. "What's that got to do with it?"

"Because mind magic means getting to cheat at life," Elysia grinned a Marauder grin. "And I'm going to help you cheat like mad."

Other than regular movie nights and Hogsmeade triad dates, October passed relatively quietly, with few exceptions. The first was Luna's 14th birthday on the 11th.

"It's international Coming-Out Day, too," Luna told them. "Apropos, I always thought."

Another party in the Room of Requirement occurred, the weekend before, in similar vein to Hermione's. Elysia gave Luna her own set of curse-breaker's goggles and amulet, a matched set to Hermione's but trimmed in chrome instead of brass. Hermione gave her a bracelet that let her mind-speak at a distance with the other two girls as if they were using legilimency. They ended the night watching _Star Wars,_ and Luna taught everyone her lightsaber spell.

The second exception was another confrontation between Elysia and Dumbledore. She was called to his office after dinner one night, and entered to find him glaring at her over his desk.

"Did you think I wouldn't figure it out, Harry?" He said, with a look of grandfatherly disappointment.

"My name is _Elysia,_" she bit out. "Regardless of anything else, I am neither named 'Harry' nor am I a boy."

"Be that as it may," Dumbledore waved a hand dismissively. "You are still the child of James and Lily Potter, and you are from Godric's Hollow, _not_ Canada."

"Prove it," Elysia snapped.

Dumbledore gestured to one of the whirring gadgets on his desk. It had a dial on it, and the needle was pointing straight at Elysia.

"That may mean something to you, Headmaster, but you'll have to enlighten me."

"Come now, Mist -- er, _Miss_ Potter. Must you be so hostile?"

"Must you be so condescending?" She retorted.

Dumbledore sighed. "That device is keyed to your blood. It's also tied to the wards at the Dursley residence. So you see, there is no way you could be anyone _but_ Harry Potter, even if you have chosen another name. There's no running from Destiny."

"Are you speaking of prophecy, sir?"

Dumbledore's eyes widened in shock. "How do you know of the prophecy?"

"You've done little enough to earn my trust, Headmaster. I believe I'll keep that little tidbit to myself."

"Fine." Dumbledore barked. "How did you hide your eyes and your scar?"

"Make-up and tinted contacts," Elysia smirked. "You wizards never even _consider_ doing things the muggle way."

Dumbledore nodded. "I see. But _why?_ The wizarding world is not so intolerant as the muggle world about such things. Why would you hide the truth?"

"As you yourself once said, Headmaster," Elysia retorted, standing. "The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. If that's all, sir."

She swept out the door, leaving Dumbledore gaping behind her.
