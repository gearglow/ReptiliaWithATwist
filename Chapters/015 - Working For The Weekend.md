## Chapter 15: Working For The Weekend

Dinner seemed to drag on forever. Elysia made sure to eat enough, because she doubted she'd get much sleep tonight. First, she had to catch Sirius up on everything -- and there was _so much!_ And then there were the two rituals, and then the knowledge transfers. If she got to bed before dawn, she'd consider it a win.

Finally, Luna, Hermione, Ginny, and Nell met up in the Gryffindor common room, while Elysia grabbed her trunk from her dorm and brought it down. Elysia placed it in an out-of-the-way corner with the strongest notice-me-not paling she could cast, and then everyone filed into the trunk flat -- where she told them the Secret -- and out to the Kiln.

Robbie had finished furnishing and stocking the farmhouse. He'd set aside the master suite for Elysia, so Sirius was set up in one of the four other bedrooms, and was currently enjoying a hot shower in one of the the hall bathrooms -- by singing along to Led Zeppelin's 'Black Dog', apparently.

"Is he--?" Hermione asked.

"Singing the most obvious song possible in the most obvious way possible? Yup!" Robbie said, greeting them as they all entered the greatroom. "At least he's on-key."

"Alright then," Elysia said. "While we're waiting around, Nell, Ginny, it's time for you to become animagi."

"What." Nell said flatly.

"Really!?" Ginny squealed.

"Sure," Elysia said. "Trust me, this is the _least_ weird part of what's going to happen tonight. Come on, get comfortable and grab my hands. _Legilimens!_"

She pulled them both into her mindscape, and got her first look at Nell as she saw herself.

"Um." Ginny said, blushing a lovely bright pink.

Nell had the same round face, with softer lines. Her dirty-blonde hair came down to her shoulder blades, and had a few streaks of darker brown which brought out her warm brown eyes. She still had her baby fat, but now it was distributed in a more curvaceous pear-shaped figure. Elysia popped a mirror in front of her.

"Is--is that _me?_" Nell asked faintly. She ran her hands over herself as if she couldn't quite believe it. "It is. _It is!_" Tears sprang to her eyes as a beatific smile lit up her face, and she lunged to Elysia and gave her a crushing hug. "Thank you," she sobbed into Elysia's shoulder.

"Don't thank me yet, Nell," Elysia said, returning the hug. "We've got a busy night ahead of us before you get to stay this way. And the sooner we do, the sooner we get to take you shopping! Come on, let's get started."

She led a tearfully-smiling Nell and a slightly dazed Ginny to the study.

### The Kiln, Red Wharf Bay, Wales, UK	1994/11/04 20:16



Elysium was a busy place that evening. First Ginny and Nell were told all about what was up with Elysia this year, and delved into Janet's reading list, particularly the animagus book. They also met James and Lily, who named their animagus forms. Ginny was a tigress, whom Lily named Durga, and Nell was a lioness, which Lily named Freya.

And then there was Sirius.

Elysia, Nell, and Ginny had just opened their eyes when Sirius walked in, still toweling his hair.

"Sirius!" Elysia cried, and pounced on him with a crushing hug.

"Pup!? Is that you?" Sirius asked as the hug broke. "Wow, you look amazing! And happy," he added. "When I got your last letter I was worried."

Elysia grinned, a feral spark in her eyes. "I'm not the one you should worry about. Everyone, the infamous Sirius Black. Siri, these are my girlfriends Hermione Granger, whom you already know, and Luna Lovegood. And then this is Ginny Weasley and Nell Longbottom."

"Nell?" Sirius' brow furrowed, then cleared. "Ah, I see. She's like you, then?"

"Yeah. Have a seat, Padfoot, it's going to be a long night. Can the rest of you start setting up for the Morphogenesis ritual? We'll be along once Sirius is caught up."

"The _what?_ Pup, what is going on here?"

"You'll see. Now sit down! Trust me, it'll be worth it."

Sirius finally settled onto the sofa as the others trooped downstairs. Elysia locked eyes with him. "_Legilimens._

"Whu--?"

They dropped into Elysium, where James pounced before Sirius could even find his footing, knocking them both to the living room floor.

"Padfoot!"

"Oof! What -- _Prongs?_" Sirius gasped. "Is it really you?" His eyes filled with tears and he hugged James tightly. 

"As close as it gets without necromancy, anyway," Lily agreed, from next to Elysia.

Sirius sat up finally, sniffling a bit. "Okay, for the umpteenth time, _what_ is going on here? Lils, is this _your_ doing?"

Lily snorted. "I wish."

Elysia cocked an eyebrow. "Why would this be Mum's doing?"

"Pup, dunno if you've noticed, but your mother is a _little scary._ As in, she's tiny and _eldritch._"

Lily grinned, James laughed, and Elysia looked thoughtful. 

"So _that's_ where I get it from." She grinned, matching Lily's slightly feral gleam.

Sirius stared at James. "Help me, Prongs, there's two of them!"

James cackled. "Isn't it great?"

Eventually, they managed to bring Sirius up to speed, including the Secret of the Kiln, and Elysia got him to read _Processing Trauma._ Twelve years in Azkaban left its scars, not least of all the decade-and-change of living and growing he'd missed out on. In many ways, Sirius still thought and acted like he was fresh out of his teens. But now the shadows that haunted his gaze weren't as dark or as deep, and the light in his eyes stayed brighter for longer.

Finally, Elysia and Sirius joined the others in the ritual chamber below the farmhouse.

"Alright," Elysia said, once everyone was in position. "We've got two rituals to do tonight. The first one is the Morphogenesis Ritual, which is bio-alchemy. Things are going to get a bit messy. I've already prepared the reagent. Everyone, take a sip and pass it to your left when I give the signal."

She waved a hand and the lights went out, the room now only lit by the ritual candles. The subjects of the ritual -- Hermione, Luna, Ginny, Nell, and Sirius -- stood at each point of a pentagram. Between each point was a candle, and around the pentagram was a ring of runes between two circles. 

Elysia sliced her finger, moved to the northernmost point and began pacing deosil, chanting and gesturing. As she moved, the others took up a completely different chant, and lines of light and magic began to take shape. At each point where the pentagram touched the inner circle, right behind each participant, she dripped a few drops of blood. When she had dripped at each point she shifted the wound closed, and a wall of faintly-shimmering magic enclosed the circle.

A phantom bell began to toll, and Elysia gave the signal. Hermione took a sip from the flask Elysia had given her, passing it to Luna, who passed it to Nell, then Ginny, then Sirius. The empty bottle was tucked away in a pocket.

The chanting reached a crescendo. Elysia lifted her arms high and shouted the final words. The others all threw their heads back and screamed, blood feeling as if it were on fire and the glow of magic streaming from their eyes and wide-open mouths. Finally, the magic abated and they all slumped to the ground. The phantom bell gave a final toll, and the candles blew out in an otherworldly wind.

In the pitch-black of the chamber, Elysia could hear only the gasping breath of the others. She brought the lights up slowly, and found them all sprawled on the chamber floor, wide-eyed and shaking.

"Everyone okay?" She asked, moving to help them sit up.

"Yeah," Ginny said. Her voice was rough.

Elysia floated some bottles of water to each of them, which they took gratefully and drained.

"So that's the hard part done," she said, to everyone's relief.

"Worth it," Nell said.

After a break and snacks, Elysia and Robbie gathered the components for the Unlimited Flight Imbuement ritual, and they all returned to the chamber. 

Inside the rune circle, they removed the pentagram and inscribed a hexagram with a paint made from crushed eggshells. At each point, nestled upon a bed of feathers, a crystal was placed which had been charged with a single component spell of the main Unlimited Flight spell: anti-gravity, acceleration, raw velocity, inertial compensation, agility, and a triggering charm. In the center, a larger crystal was placed; it was charged with the full Unlimited Flight spell. Its feather nest was woven through with a hair from each of them.

They each sliced a finger and dripped a few drops into the rune circle. Magic flared, the lights dimmed, and they drew their wands and began chanting, "_Hegan egin mugarik gabe! Hegan egin mugarik gabe!_"

As they chanted, the central crystal floated into the air, followed by the ancillary crystals. The smaller crystals began orbiting the larger in intricate patterns, weaving in and out and leaving braided ribbons of light in their wake. Finally, the crystals orbiting so fast they could no longer be seen, there was a blast of light and magic, which buffeted the runic circle's barrier. With one final chant, they all stepped forward, breaking the barrier.

Light flared. Light filled them. They _were_ light.

They floated for a moment that lasted an eternity.

Finally, the light faded, seeping into their very beings, and they opened their eyes to find themselves floating a foot above the ground.

"Sweet _Morgana,_" Hermione gasped.

"What a _rush!_" Nell exclaimed.

Ginny just giggled euphorically.

Luna floated serenely over to Elysia and kissed her, suddenly and passionately, before doing the same to Hermione.

Sirius was crying tears of joy. "I... I haven't felt this weightless _ever,_" he sobbed. "For the first time in my life, I feel _free._"

Elysia smiled. "Not quite yet, Padfoot. First, I need to teach you all how to shape-shift. And then. Oh, _then_ you'll know true freedom."

They all ended up in the living room in Elysium, where Janet carted in a stack of books for each of them. Luna and Hermione only had the metamorphmagus and shapeshifting books, along with the addition of _Battle Magic for the Baddest Bitches_ and _Magician, Heal Thyself,_ while the others had the same reading list and additions to catch up on. Elysia spent the time going over the information on the horcruxes and plotting with her parents and Janet.

"Most of these will be pretty easy with Sirius helping," James said. "He can access the locket in Grimmauld Place, and as Lord Black he can annul Bellatrix's marriage to Rodolphus Lestrange. That triggers repayment of her dowry and reversion of all her assets, which, since the Cup is in her personal vault, means Sirius can simply walk into Gringotts and withdraw it."

"That's convenient," Elysia said.

"The Diadem you can deal with whenever," Lily said. "Might want it sooner rather than later, though. If you clear out the horcrux, its power will give you an _enormous_ edge."

"I'll probably grab it tomorrow, then," Elysia said. "I could use the help when I modify my Firebolt. The Ring is the one I'm worried about. Riddle will likely be watching the Gaunt Shack fairly closely right now."

"Worry about that when the time comes," James said. "Worst case, just have Robbie on standby to glass the place with Fiendfyre as soon as Riddle's in the middle of the ritual."

"That'll work," Lily said with an evil smile. "And then there's just the snake and the man himself, which should be no trouble for you in the moment."

"Awesome," Elysia said. "Well, nothing left to do but kick some arse."

Ginny and Nell both read _Processing Trauma,_ and the difference, while not as stark as with Sirius, was substantial. Nell was much more confident, especially now that she finally fit her own self-image. Ginny still had claws, but she'd lost the desperate edge and occasional spirals of despair she'd had for most of the last year.



-----



Eventually, everyone was done reading and they all decided to go for a night flight around the grounds. As the entire property was both heavily warded and under _Fidelius,_ there was no need to worry about being seen as long as they didn't fly too high -- the wards capped at roughly a mile up.

"This is the _life,_" Sirius said, lazily floating on his back.

"Right?" Elysia said. She, Luna, and Hermione were also floating on their backs, heads together and holding hands. The moon was a waxing crescent, and so didn't wash out the stars. The night sky was cloudy, but not enough to completely block out the view, and it had been an exceptionally mild autumn thus far, so they had barely even needed warming charms.

Nell had drifted down to explore among the woods, and Ginny was performing increasingly daring aerobatic feats and having the time of her life. And Robbie, always one to stay busy, had decided to check the pond for fish.

"So, a broom race, huh, Pup?" Sirius asked.

Hermione smirked. "I know that at least three of the other champions are aces on brooms, but let's be real: Ellie's got this in the bag."

Elysia grinned devilishly. "I'm going to strip the limiter on my Firebolt. Should break the sound barrier in two to three seconds, and top out around Mach 1.8."

Sirius' eyes widened and he bounced a few feet higher up. "Sweet Merlin!"

Luna giggled. "You _do_ know we can go much faster _without_ a broom, now?"

"Just remember to shift your skin and eyes and such to something that can handle the friction," Hermione cautioned. "I imagine windburn at those speeds would be like being sandblasted."

"Ghostform," Elysia said. "That's my secret weapon for the Tournament. Anything like that comes up, and a quick 影 肉体 (_kage nikutai,_ "shadow body") and I'll just ghost right through it."

"I think I like the poltergeist variation better," Hermione quipped. "It's got telekinesis built in. No having to split focus for another spell."

"Good point," Elysia acknowledged. "Might be worth an imbuement ritual too, come to think of it. But anyway, the Firebolt has a windscreen charm out to a couple of feet. Anything much smaller than a snitch gets shunted around. If I stretch it out to wrap completely, that should take care of both windburn and drafting problems. And if I can work in a silencer somehow, that should help mitigate the sonic boom. Leave the eardrum-shattering to Lemmy."

Sirius cackled. "Let me guess, 'Ace of Spades?'"

"Damn right! Ooh, that reminds me, any of you lot want to watch the Weighing of the Wands highlight reel in the pensieve?"

### Hogwarts Grounds, Scotland	1994/11/05, 08:30	Bonfire Night

They _did_ manage to get back to Hogwarts and into bed before dawn, as it turned out. Granted, it was a near thing, but Elysia still managed most of a full night's sleep. After the late night, she felt justified in skipping most of her training for the day, but she still met Hermione and Luna (and now Ginny and Nell) for a quick run before breakfast and some calisthenics on the grounds right after.

As it was later than they were usually out, other students were around enjoying the comparatively warm (though cloudy) weather. They saw Millie, Lisa, and Megan having a picnic by the lake, and Izzy doing pull-ups on a convenient tree. 

("Merlin and Morgana, that girl's buff!" Nell commented as they drew close enough to see her muscles straining her workout gear.) 

Cormac McLaggen, a Gryffindor 5th-year, was flying around on his broom and leered at them until all five of them hit him with a targeted "you're a bug and I'm going to splat you" aura, at which point he paled and flew off, nearly crashing several times.

"You lot are scary sometimes," Izzy commented.

"Oh, hey Izzy," Elysia said, making introductions.

Izzy dropped down from the tree she'd still been hanging from. "So what brings you all out here on such a cold, grey day?"

Hermione snorted. "Cold? Grey I'll grant you, but this is positively _balmy_ for Scotland in November. Why, it's practically summer still!"

"Plus, all the exercise warms you right up!" Luna added.

Just then, Anna walked by in track pants and a sports bra, her hair back in a tight pony-tail. "How can anyone stand this heat!" She complained in Russian. "These girls in _jackets,_ of all things. How do they not melt?"

("Oh, I am _way_ too gay for this," Izzy muttered, biting her lip.)

"It's even hotter now that you're here," Elysia said in Russian, winking.

Anna blushed, eyes wide in surprise.

Hermione smacked her arm, laughing, and Luna giggled.

"What?" Elysia said in Euskara, with an impish grin. "It's fun to fluster the stoic ones."

Izzy giggled. "No wonder they call you Heart-Breaker," she teased, switching back to English. "What exactly did you say, anyway?"

"She said," Anna said with an odd sort of tone to her voice, "that it's even hotter now that I'm here."

Izzy whistled. "Smooth. Wish _I'd_ though of it." She winked at Anna. "True, too. I feel my temperature rising already."

Anna blushed deeper, biting her lip.

"Yeah, what the hell, Potter? You weren't this smooth last year," Ginny said.

"You weren't this smooth _last week,_" Nell added.

("Yes, she was," Luna said smugly.)

"It's like I told Hermione over the summer. It's easier when you're not that invested in it."

Anna cocked an eyebrow.

Elysia shrugged. "You're like three years older than me and I'm very much taken by these two," she responded, wrapping her arms around Luna and Hermione.

"It is easy to forget you are so young," Anna said. "You carry yourself well."

"My dad's probably spinning in his grave as I say this, but that's Professor Snape's fault," Elysia said. "He told me the other day to have a song playing in your head and pretend you're the rock star, and _own_ it. Seems to be working."

"Much like my own method, then," Anna said approvingly. "Shoulders back, stride evenly, and think, _murder._"

"Ooh, I _like_ you!" Ginny exclaimed with a grin.

"You are a bit young for me, I think," Anna said, deadpan.

Ginny blushed.

"How about me?" Izzy said, prowling closer.

"Hmph. We shall see," Anna said, her eyes sparkling mischievously.



-----



After a late breakfast, wherein Rita Skeeter's article about the champions proved to be as fair as promised, Elysia went with Nell to speak with Professor McGonagall about switching dorms and about leaving the castle to get her a new, more appropriate, wardrobe. McGonagall offered to take her to get the basics, and anything more could be acquired at the next Hogsmeade weekend on the 19th.

"I'm surprised at you, Miss Longbottom," she admonished. "You're certainly not the first girl in your situation I've had in my care. Had you but told me, I would've helped you have the ritual performed through proper channels."

"I know," Nell said, hanging her head a bit. "But my gran would never listen. Sometimes it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission."

McGonagall sighed. "Augusta can be particularly stubborn at times, 'tis true. Well, you'll hear no more of it from me, unless you would like my assistance with your grandmother when the time comes."

Nell smiled. "I'd very much appreciate it."



-----

### Room of Lost Things, Hogwarts	1994/11/05 13:45	Bonfire Night

After Professor McGonagall left with Nell, Elysia took the opportunity to retrieve the Diadem from the Room of Requirement. She met Robbie and her girlfriends outside the Room and they went over the plan, such as it was.

"So that's it?" Hermione said. "Just walk up and hit it with the horcrux-zapper? What about if it has _other_ curses?"

"It probably does," Elysia agreed. "But they'll be much easier to deal with in a proper workspace, which the Room of Lost Things most certainly _isn't._"

"And what about traps in the Room itself?"

"That's why I'm not going it alone. You and Luna are both much better at analysis than me, not to mention curse-breaking proper. And then there's Robbie. If the four of _us_ can't handle whatever's in there, I think even Dumbledore would have trouble."

"We've got this!" Luna exclaimed.

"Thank you for doing this with me, my loves," Elysia said, kissing them both. "And you too, bro," she added, hugging Robbie.

Hermione and Luna slipped their goggles into place, and Elysia flipped her glasses into Active mode. She paced back and forth three times, thinking "I need the place where everything is hidden."

The door appeared, and in they went.

"My goodness," Luna exclaimed. "There's _mountains_ of stuff in here!"

"It's worse than the Wardstone Chamber," Hermione agreed, sighing.

Elysia grinned. "_Monstrant viam!_"

The other two girls face-palmed. Robbie chuckled.

A glowing path drew itself out from Elysia's feet, and the four of them took off, flying high enough to avoid most of the piles of detritus.

"How does this place work, I wonder," Luna mused aloud as they flew. "The Room isn't static, so I'd imagine the usual sort of wards wouldn't stick."

"I don't know about the Room," Hermione said, "but I'd think that means most of the Diadem's defenses would be tied to it directly. Compulsions tied to trigger-fired curses, contact poisons, that sort of thing. Perhaps it's in a box, and _that's_ warded and trapped."

"Given that our boy Tomothy hid the thing here when he was supposedly interviewing for the DADA position," Elysia commented, "I don't think he had much time to set up defenses. My money's on him trapping the Diadem itself, no matter _how_ the Room works."

"Makes our job here simpler, at least," Robbie said, snickering at 'Tomothy'. "And there it is!"

In quite the anticlimax, the glowing path led straight to what, if they hadn't known better, looked like nothing so much as a piece of cheap costume jewelry, nestled among a pile of oddities -- a dusty old wig, a chipped bust, stained robes. Their goggles showed plenty of magic on the Diadem itself, but no ward-lines, or any other magic aside from the Room's ambient aura.

"Here's hoping the rest of it's this easy," Elysia said. "_Suntsitu arima lotua!_"

A bolt of magic, the color of which none of them could quite process, flew from her wand and struck the Diadem with the sound of a large bell tolling far away. A cloud of black smoke flowed from it, as if a candle had been snuffed, and a haunting scream could be heard, as if from an out-of-tune radio station, until it dissipated completely.

Hermione conjured a lead box, which Luna levitated the Diadem into. They could feel a compulsion to wear the Diadem as it drew near, but their occlumency held. Then the four of them flew back out to the hallway, where Elysia reset the Room to be a fully-equipped Enchanting workshop.

"_Tempus,_" Hermione muttered. _15:12._ "We've got just under three hours until dinner."

"That should be enough to at least get an idea of what we're dealing with," Luna said. "Though whatever it is, it's _mean._ The wrackspurts are _swarming_ around it."

She had placed the now-open box on a shielded work table (which looked quite a bit like a quarantine station in a biology lab) and was peering at the Diadem through an enchanted lens. The others joined her, and after much investigation, they realized just _how_ mean.

"I-is that a _soul virus!?_" Hermione gasped, a look of abject horror on her face.

"That's _abhorrent!_" Luna exclaimed, outraged.

"This might actually be worse than the horcruxes," Elysia said faintly, face pale.

Robbie shuddered with revulsion, and then asked the important question. "Can we salvage the Diadem, or do we give it a bath in basilisk venom and dry it off with fiendfyre?"

_Take off and nuke it from orbit,_ Janet said, with the feeling of ice-water trickling across Elysia's scalp. _Rowena left you the original recipe, so you can fry this one but good._

_Kentucky-Fried Horcrux, huh?_ "Janet says I've got instructions on making a new Diadem," Elysia informed the others. "Let's wipe this abomination from the face of the planet."

### The Three Broomsticks, Hogsmeade, Scotland	1994/11/06 12:00

They spent the next morning in Elysium, preparing for the lunch interview with Rita Skeeter. By the time Elysia walked into the Three Broomsticks at noon, she felt pretty good about it all.

A man in business robes met her as she entered, introducing himself as Solicitor Marius Bulstrode.

"Ah, you must be Millie's father!" Elysia exclaimed, shaking his hand.

"Indeed," Solicitor Bulstrode agreed. "She speaks quite highly of you."

"It's mutual, I assure you."

They headed back to a private room, where Rita met them a few minutes later.

"Miss Potter!" She greeted, a predatory gleam in her eye.

"Rita!" Elysia said, radiating affability. "I thought I told you to call me Ellie. Drink?"

"Don't mind if I do," Rita said.

"Rita, this is Marius Bulstrode, of Eberhardt, Bulstrode, & Tonks. We have a proposition for you."

Rita raised one eyebrow, hastily swallowing her sip of firewhiskey. "Do tell."

"We're going to take down Albus Dumbledore."

Rita dropped her glass.



-----



After Elysia gave Rita the broad-strokes story of how Albus Dumbledore had screwed her over, including the sealing of her parents' will, conversation turned to Sirius Black.

"You mean to tell me," Rita said, aghast, "that a Lord of a Most Ancient and Noble House was imprisoned for over a decade _without a trial?_"

"And Dumbledore was in on it," Elysia confirmed. "You see why I want to take him down. One single man shouldn't have that much power, or that much blind trust."

"But _why?_" Rita asked.

"Because someone faked a prophecy and in his desperation he took it to be about me. Well, me or one other, and he set up both sets of parents to see which. And he was -- and is -- arrogant enough to believe that only he is wise enough to be able to dictate my so-called destiny. Never mind that he's obsessed with sacrifice and redeeming the unrepentant at the cost of those who never fell in the first place. Just look at his policy on bullying."

Rita nodded faintly.

Solicitor Bulstrode spoke up. "We'd like you, Ms. Skeeter, to work with our firm in an investigative capacity to build our case. We have all the testimony we could ever wish from Miss Potter, but we need to gather corroborating evidence as well. In return, you get exclusive rights to all stories stemming from what is uncovered, contingent on approval on behalf of Miss Potter before publishing, of course."

"Of course," Skeeter murmured. She finished off her drink. "Well, this is quite a lot to process. But I think -- provisionally -- that I'm in. Where do we start?"

"Sirius' lack of a trial, I think," Elysia said. "There are public records there that not only prove the matter, but bring up openings to all the rest. And I'm pretty sure Gringotts can say conclusively whether or not Peter Pettigrew is still alive -- and time of death if he isn't -- if the Wizengamot formally requests the information."

"They can," Bulstrode confirmed.

"Well, then," Rita said. "Let's talk turkey."

The interview and contract negotiations took until nearly dinner time.
