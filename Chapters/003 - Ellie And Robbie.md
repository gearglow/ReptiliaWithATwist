## Chapter 3: Ellie And Robbie

Opening her eyes with a start, Harry looked down at herself. She was in boy-mode again; as uncomfortable as it was, she knew she would have to stay boy-shaped for the moment. All the more reason to get some independence, she supposed.

She went through her morning routine, including the silent treatment at breakfast with the Dursleys, then dug out her Gringotts key and money pouch and headed to the park down Wisteria Walk. Tucking herself away among a cluster of bushes, she called out softly, "Dobby!"

With a quiet *pop,* Dobby the House-Elf appeared. "Great Harry Potter Sir is calling for Dobby!" He gushed, bowing so low that his long, floppy ears brushed the ground.

"Dobby," Harry said, "How would you like to be my elf?"

Dobby nodded frantically, so overcome he could only squeak.

"Dobby, I claim you as my elf," Harry said, remembering the formal oath from her earlier reading. "My magic to your magic, my strength to your strength, my knowledge to your knowledge, my secrets to your secrets. Henceforth, you shall be known as a Potter elf. And as a part of my family," Harry added, though this wasn't in the formal oath. "So mote it be!"

A soft glow surrounded the two for a moment, and as it faded Dobby leapt to embrace Harry.

"*Family* to the Great Harry Potter! And so much *knowledge!* Dobby is... *overwhelmed!*"

Harry hugged back and smiled. "Me too, Dobby. We're going to really shake things up together, you and I."

"Great Harry Potter Miss has plans?"

Harry thought for a second. "First, Dobby, nobody else knows I'm a girl yet, and I want to keep it that way for now. Just call me Harry. We *are* family now, after all."

Dobby nodded, tears in his eyes and a smile on his face.

"Second," Harry continued, "I know that your speech patterns are because of your time with the Malfoys, but you're part of the Potter family now. You're not a servant, not a lesser being. You are a Potter, and as such you're expected to stand tall and speak with confidence."

"I understand, Harry," Dobby said.

"I'm still working on that myself," Harry mused with a smile. "We can help each other out on that, yeah?"

"Okay," Dobby agreed.

"Thanks, Dobby. Now, I've got some plans for today. I want to end the day with more independence than I started it with, and the next step is to see what resources we have. So we're off to Gringotts," Harry said. "What do you think is the best way to do this? The Knight Bus, maybe?"

"Dobby can -- err, *I* can bring you straight to Gringotts, Harry. We elves has -- *have* our own kind of magic. Like apparition, only not, you see."

"That sounds good," Harry replied. "Shall we?" 

Dobby wrapped Harry in a hug, and they were off to Diagon Alley.

> To Do

> - [x] Bond with Dobby as your house elf



They reappeared with a *pop* in a cordoned-off section of the Gringotts lobby, and Dobby immediately dragged Harry over to one of the lines. "So the next person doesn't be landing on you," he said. After a short wait, they got to a teller, who glared down at them from the abnormally high counter.

"Yes?" The goblin asked, in a rather put-out voice.

"May blood and gold flow at your feet. I'd like a full accounting of my holdings, please," Harry said.

"Key?" The goblin said shortly.

Harry handed over the key. The goblin took it and did something behind the counter, then handed it back. "Lockjaw will take you to an account manager. Lockjaw!"

Another goblin, Lockjaw presumably, led them through an opulent door into a maze of opulent hallways. Eventually, they came to another opulent door, which Lockjaw led them through before ducking back out.

Another goblin, built like a gnarled old oak tree with a bushy white beard, was seated behind a desk, with a gas-lamp and several ledgers on it. He gestured to the chairs in front of the desk and introduced himself. "I am Claymore, the account manager for the Potter estate. I wasn't expecting you for a few more years, Mr. Potter."

Harry inwardly cringed at being addressed as 'Mr.' but shrugged it off. *Not yet,* she told herself. "Harry is fine, Claymore," she told the goblin. "May this meeting bring profit to our clans and ruin to our enemies." So saying, she had a seat in one chair and gestured for Dobby to take the other. "This is Dobby, my friend and advisor."

"Well met, Harry, Dobby. What brings you to Gringotts today?"

"I recently came to the conclusion that I have been far too reactive in my life thus far, and have decided to do something about it. The first step, then, is to take stock. So my first order of business is a full accounting of my available assets. Depending on the results, we'll go from there."

Claymore nodded and, after digging around in a desk drawer for a moment, produced a small, ornate stiletto dagger; a roll of parchment; a small screw-top inkwell; and a red quill. "Well then, Harry, what say we start with a lineage trace?" He screwed the inkwell onto the dagger's hilt and gestured for the back of Harry's hand. After passing the blade through the gas-lamp's flame several times, he gently slid the point into a vein. The stiletto blade, it turned out, was hollow, and Harry's blood began to fill the inkwell. 

Once it filled, Harry shifted the wound closed. Claymore blinked at this, but said nothing. Unscrewing the inkwell once more, he made some gestures with the dagger over the quill, dipped it into the inkwell full of Harry's blood, and set it on the now-unrolled parchment.

It began to draw quite rapidly, and after a few minutes, Harry could see a family tree. When it finished, Claymore waved the dagger over the inkwell and quill and the blood vanished. He placed everything but the parchment back in the drawer and gestured Harry closer.

"Well now, let's see... Hmm. No real surprises here... Oh! Seems you're in the line of succession for the House of Black. Well, no bearing on anything for today. One moment, I'll have a clerk bring the most recent statements."

Claymore knocked on a bronze pipe which was sticking out of the wall, then yelled something into it in Gobbledegook. Thanks to the Primer on Goblins Harry had read in Elysium that morning, she found that she understood most of it. It seemed that Lockjaw was Claymore's apprentice, and had been sent to Records for the requested statements. *Huh,* she thought to herself. *Hadn't realized I'd picked up Gobbledegook. Wonder what else I don't know that I know?*

Lockjaw entered the room a few minutes later, handed over a folder, and left again.

#### Holdings and Estate of the House of Potter

> - Other aggregate shares - see page 12

The rest of the folder was fine-print regarding the farm and business, but what caught Harry's attention (aside from the sheer amount) was that note about personal effects. *Perhaps something of my parents'?* Catching Claymore's attention, she asked, "Claymore, a couple of things have caught my eye. First, the portkey to the property at Red Wharf. Am I able to request use of that now, or do I need to wait until I come of age?"

"Well, I don't suppose there's any harm in you going to look at the place," he replied, "but ownership doesn't transfer to you until you come of age. Still, might be a good idea to be able to plan for it."

"Thank you, Claymore. I'd like to schedule that for tomorrow, then. And second," she continued, "do I have access to the storage vault yet, or only the trust vault? I'd like to examine the personal effects."

"You are indeed able to access that vault. I gather you'd like to do so today?"

"Once we're finished here, please. One last thing - I note that there is a significant amount of liquid assets in the main vault which are not being put to work. Is there anything we can do about that right now?"

"Very astute for one so young," Claymore nodded in approval. "Unfortunately, as far as the law is concerned, investment counts as withdrawal, so until you reach your majority neither you nor your guardians can do anything with it. Pity. That was mostly old Fleamont's proceeds from selling off his potions company when he retired. James, your father, never had a chance to do anything with it either. That money's been sitting idle for more than 20 years by now."

"How about the trust vault? What can you do with, say, 25,000 galleons? Something with aggressive earning potential, I'd hope. At, oh, 40% commission? That should leave enough interest income for discretionary spending, too."

"Now you're speaking my language, lad!" Claymore laughed. "Any particulars, or shall I use my best judgement?"

"I think we understand each other, Claymore. You'd know better than I what opportunities there are at present."

"I can think of a few, lad," Claymore said. "Magical only, or muggle as well?"

"Either or both, I should think," Harry said. "Which reminds me, I'll need to withdraw from my trust vault, and change a fair bit to pounds, at some point today."

"Aye, we'll get Lockjaw to take care of you, lad. Anything else?"

"No sir. Thank you for all your help today. May your enemies cower before you and your coffers never empty."

"Same to you, lad, same to you. Lockjaw!"



-----



Lockjaw took Harry and Dobby much further down on the minecart than she'd been before. By the time they stopped, she could see the end of the tracks in the distance.

"Vault fifteen, Potter Storage Vault," Lockjaw announced. He hopped out of the cart, Harry and Dobby following, and stroked one long finger down the door. The door opened with a puff of green smoke, and the two entered. Lockjaw stayed at the entrance, unfolding a comfortable chair from seemingly nowhere and relaxing into it.

The vault looked like the back room of an antique shop. Furniture was stacked in one corner, bookshelves filled with books in another. Racks of portraits were next to a stack of trunks and several cabinets and credenzas. Rugs and tapestries lay rolled in piles along one wall. Each item had a small parchment tag attached. Next to the door was a roll of parchment with a list of tag designators matched to descriptions of the tagged items.

Dobby snagged the list and the two went over it for a bit, deciding what to focus on. While the folder Claymore had given them listed *what* was in the vault, there was so much that actually finding anything in particular took some doing.

The first thing Harry examined were the trunks. Most of them were the standard Hogwarts 'Firstie' trunk, but there were a few with substantial enhancements. A couple were even listed as "residential" trunks, which, when Harry opened them, turned out to contain an entire house's-worth of rooms inside. 

"Dobby, come look at this and tell me what you think," Harry called. She'd found that one of the residential trunks was made of *lignum vitae* of all things, which, according to the primer on Enchanting she'd devoured this morning, meant it could handle a much larger amount of magic without overloading. It also seemed to have a rather sizable rune schema locus, though she couldn't find the stone that should have been inside. With no rune schema, the interior of the trunk defaulted to a 10ft^3^ room, containing only the locus pedestal and the ladder out.

"D'you think," she continued, "that a trunk like this could handle a dueling chamber without burning out?"

Dobby squinted at it, then climbed down to examine the locus pedestal more closely. Climbing back out, he nodded. "A smallish one. Enough for three, maybe four people casting at once. More would be too much for the thaumic bleed-off rate."

"And maybe a smallish apartment, and a workshop, along with?"

"Oh, easily, Harry! Capacity is no problem with this trunk."

Harry nodded. "I guess we're taking it with us today, then! We'll have to pick up a new control stone before we leave the Alley. Now, what about some of this furniture?"

In the end, they'd managed to find enough furniture to outfit a small two-bedroom apartment; a pensieve; journals from James, Lily, and both of James' parents; several volumes of Potter Family grimoires; Lily's old textbooks, along with her reference library; some House Potter elf uniforms (one of which Dobby promptly exchanged for his current garb); and several articles of clothing that looked to be close enough in size for Harry to shift herself into a perfect fit without it being obvious. The dragon-hide boots and matching jackets -- a set each of Ukrainian Ironbelly and Hebridean Black -- were a particularly nice find, and even had resizing, waterproofing, and temperature-control charms worked into them. Harry decided to change out of Dudley's cast-offs before they continued their errands, and ducked into the trunk.

She emerged wearing close-fitting jeans, a black v-neck t-shirt, and the Ironbelly boots and jacket. She'd also shifted her hair into a rakish mop, making the usual messy bird's nest look intentional. In all, she felt comfortably androgynous. It wasn't quite as feminine as she'd've liked, but she felt far better than before.

"What do you think, Dobby?" She asked, spinning around.

"Very nice!" Dobby exclaimed.

*Now what was next on the list?* She thought. Dropping into Elysium for a second, she recalled the list in the binder. There was something new on the list, though upon reflection she'd already known about it.

> To Do
>
> - [x] Take the Knight Bus to Gringotts ASAP and get a full accounting
> - [ ] Outfit the trunk as a proper living and training space (inc. foodstuffs and utensils)
>
> - [ ] Establish a training regimen (see Appendix A)

The trunk had a few convenience enchantments which were standard for most high-end magical luggage -- Self-shrinking, featherlight, and so forth. As such, once they'd gathered everything they wanted to bring from the vault during this trip, Harry shrank the trunk and slipped it into a pocket.

"Thank you for indulging us, Lockjaw," Harry said as they exited the vault.

They proceeded to Harry's trust vault, where Harry gathered a stack of 1,500 galleons with Dobby's help. Once back at the main floor, they bade Lockjaw farewell and stood in line to change half of the galleons to pound notes.

Back in Diagon Alley proper, it was time to find a replacement rune schema stone for the trunk. Harry and Dobby wandered down the main thoroughfare of Diagon Alley, chattering to each other about the shops they passed. In a luggage shop, Harry bought them both charmed bookbags which had an Undetectable Extension charm on them, as well as featherlight and durability charms. The proprietor also directed them to a shop up the Alley past Gringotts, where Harry picked up a variety of blank schema stones and a high-end rune-carving kit. Stopping in at an apothecary, Harry purchased a stock of medical potions, expecting to need them after the intense training she was planning. She also picked up a stock of nutrient potions to help make up for her years of malnutrition, and enough ingredients to stock a potions lab.

Finally, finished with the magical shopping, they decided to head into the Muggle world. Stepping out of the Leaky Cauldron, but still within the pub's wards, Harry shifted into proper girl-form, with longer auburn hair. She looked around for Dobby, and found instead a boy who could've been her twin brother. He had hair the same auburn as hers, though cut in a shorter, more boyish style. He was even wearing a similar outfit.

"Wha- Dobby? Is that you?" Harry yelped.

"We're in the muggle world now," Dobby replied. "House-elves mustn't be seen by muggles. I borrowed your shifting magic through the house-elf bond. Does Dobby -- er, *do I* look OK?"

"You look *brilliant,* Dobby! You could be my brother, like that! Well, we *are* family now," Harry answered. "Although, 'Dobby' is kind of an odd name for a muggle. Maybe I should call you something else? How do you feel about 'Robbie?'"

"Could... could you call me that anyway?" Robbie asked. "I'm a proud Potter elf now, and I need a name to fit."

"Robbie it is, then!" Harry said. "Hmm. I suppose I can't really answer to 'Harry' like this, either. Can't wait to be rid of that name for good, but for now..." She sighed, leaning against the wall of the pub. "Wish there was some clue from Elysium."

"Elysiu- oh, your mindscape?" Robbie asked.

"Yeah, there's all kinds of ideas kicking around in there," she replied absently. "Wait, that's it! 'Elysia!' Robbie, you're a genius!" She spun him around in a hug. "Just call me 'Ellie' for short!"

And so Ellie and Robbie set off down Charing Cross Road.


-----


After a quick stop for lunch, the two wandered the shops for the rest of the afternoon. Elysia managed to find a full set of free-weights and some gym mats, as well as both a heavy bag and a speed-bag. Gloves were a non-issue as she could simply shift them into place as needed.

They also found more clothes. Both Elysia and Robbie were reveling in the ability to wear what they wanted for once. Robbie, in particular, had a *penchánt* for socks with loud patterns, while Elysia enjoyed more form-fitting apparel after being saddled with horribly-oversized cast-offs all her life.

It also turned out that, thanks to her shifting ability, she no longer needed glasses. (She shifted away her scar, too, because _good riddance._) Since the world expected Harry Potter to wear them, though, she figured she might as well get some nice ones, and perhaps add enchantments at some point. She picked out some sunglasses with a classic look, and as they browsed at other stores, idly scratched runes in them with a fingernail shifted to a steel-hard point. She got as far as runes to darken automatically in bright sunlight, and turn clear in the shade, before they were done shopping.

Lastly, they picked up kitchenware and several appliances, bedding, curtains, and the rest of the little things that make a house feel more like a home. And after a final stop at a grocer to stock their larders, Robbie popped them both back to Elysia's room at #4 Privet Drive.

Robbie, having returned to his natural elf form, began moving the perishable goods into some of the stasis cupboards they'd found in the vault. Meanwhile, Elysia dug out one of the new schema stones and the carving kit, and sat down at the dilapidated old desk under the window to start laying out the new configuration for the trunk.

It was late into the night before she was finished. Hedwig had returned from hunting all day and was snoozing, head tucked under one wing, on the perch near the window, by the time Elysia sat back and called Robbie over.

"What do you think, are we ready to pop this in?" She asked, gesturing to the schema stone.

He leaned over it, muttering quietly under his breath, and then nodded. "I don't see any problems. I've gone over the trunk, and it's charged and ready."

"Thanks, Robbie," Elysia said, standing up and stretching. Between the two of them, they managed to get the schema stone, which was roughly the size of the Dursley's big-screen TV, maneuvered down into the trunk and settled into place on the pedestal. The trunk's interior, which had started as an empty 10ft^3^ room, shifted around them.

When everything stopped moving, they found themselves still in a 10ft^3^ room, but the ladder was gone and there was a door in its place. One of the walls was taken up with several displays, showing the status of the trunk's various wards, power levels, air and water, a view of the outside, and so on. Through the door was a spacious living room, with an elevator platform leading up out of the trunk (a button turned it into stairs and back) and an open kitchen separated by a cooktop island. A short hallway led to two bedroom suites, a spacious study with a workshop area, and a huge training room. The entire place was brightly lit by both an ambient *lumos* and large charmed bay windows throughout. It wasn't exactly a mansion, but for the two of them it was more than comfortable.

The living area was piled high with all of the spoils from the day's errands, but between the two of them they made short work of it all. In less than an hour, everything was squared away, and they fell into their beds exhausted but delighted. It was, Elysia thought to herself as she drifted off, going to be the best summer ever.
