## Chapter 9: Clearing The Air

### Hogwarts, Potions Classroom	1994/09/02	13:00

History was uneventful, aside from the many odd looks people kept giving the 'new girl.' Charms, on the other hand... When Professor Flitwick called out "Potter, Elysia" during roll, many of those looks changed to shock, and Elysia heard more than one person mutter, "oh, that's just *unfair!*"

But all of that was nothing compared to Potions. Friday afternoons were double periods with the Slytherins (*always the Slytherins,* thought Elysia. *Do they* want *explosions?*), and the look on Malfoy's face as she entered was *priceless.*

"Didn't realize Malfoy could get any more pale," Ron muttered.

"And now he's blushing," Hermione added.

Elysia smirked as the trio took their seats, Hermione sharing a table with Neville and Elysia with Ron. "He didn't even glare at me in the Great Hall today. Must've shaken him more than I thought on the train."

"I'd've thought Hermione's right hook would've done that last year," Ron replied.

Hermione grinned bashfully at that, while Neville's eyes went wide. "Wait, what? When did you *punch Malfoy?*"

"His daddy wasn't doing time in Azkaban last year, though," Elysia said. "And it was after Creatures last year, Nev, when Hagrid found out that Buckbeak was going to be put down. Malfoy was gloating, and Hermione wasn't having it."

Just then Professor Snape swept into the room, in his usual dramatic fashion. He caught sight of Elysia, turned around, and walked right back out again, the expression on his face never changing.

The students all looked at each other, most of them trying their hardest not to giggle. Finally, Elysia caught Neville's eye and they both burst out laughing.

"What just happened?" Neville wheezed, finally catching his breath.

"Wish I knew," Ron gasped.

They'd all just settled down again when Professor Snape came back in, pointedly avoiding looking in Elysia's direction.

"Potter, stay after class. Now, everyone turn to page..."

Elysia packed up with the rest of the class, but stayed seated as the other students filed out. Finally, only she and Professor Snape remained, eyeing each other warily.

She wasn't really surprised when she felt the legilimency probe. She'd always figured that if *anyone* could read minds, it was Snape, and now that she knew what to look for, she could follow the probe straight back to its source.

Apparently her resemblance to one Lily Evans was much more obvious now, to Snape at least, and it had shaken him.

*Subtle, Russ,* she sent along the commandeered probe, using the childhood nickname her mother had come up with for Snape. She watched gleefully as his eyes widened in shock, and smirked in a particularly Lily-ish way as she grabbed the probe and *tugged* Snape into Elysium.

They manifested in the living room to find James and Lily waiting for them. Before anyone else could say anything, James stood.

"Severus, I owe you an apology for everything back in our school days. We were all terrible and for my part I'm sorry."

Snape abruptly sat down, gaping, as his knees gave out. "What-? How-?"

"I think you broke him, Dad," Elysia giggled.

Snape shook his head to clear it. "Where are we? How are you here, now, *speaking* to me?"

"We're in my mindscape, Professor," Elysia answered. "Long story short, I died, got a whole bunch of afterlife training stuffed into my subconscious, and got sent back to the start of this past summer with a mindscape and memory-constructs of my parents. For all intents and purposes, they *are* my parents, at least their minds."

Snape stared. "*Mindscape? Memory-constructs?*"

"I don't actually *remember* the afterlife," Elysia continued, "or any past lives. But this way I at least have them around to give me parental guidance. Not like Aunt Petunia was ever any good for that, certainly."

"Wait. You live with *Petunia?*" Snape exclaimed, aghast. "I'm going to *kill* Albus."

"Get in line," Lily growled. "And on that note, I've got a bone to pick with you."

Snape gulped.

James ushered Elysia outside. "We don't need to be there for this part," he said. "What say we go flying 'til they're done?"




+++++



Eventually Elysia and James returned to find a much-chastened Snape.

"Ms. Potter," Snape said, somewhat hesitantly. "It seems I owe you an apology for my treatment of you these past years. There was no excuse and I shall endeavor to better my behaviour, both towards you and in general."

"Mum set you straight?" Elysia asked, trying to suppress a grin.

"At great length and substantial volume," Snape agreed sardonically. James stifled a laugh. Lily smacked him in the arm, trying (and failing) not to grin.

"Can't say better than that," Elysia said with a shrug. "Clean slate, Professor?"

"I would very much appreciate that, Ms. Potter," Snape replied.

"Why'd you hate me so much, anyway?" Elysia asked. "If you don't mind me asking."

Snape sighed. "It's not so much you as what you represented, really. When I looked at you, I saw proof that I'd lost my best friend, and that she'd taken up with one of the bullies who made my life miserable. I saw James Potter's taunting face every time, looking at me through Lily's eyes, and every time it reminded me that the only person who ever gave a damn about me was gone forever."

James looked stricken upon hearing this. Lily got up and gave Snape a hug. To Elysia's shock, he returned it.

"And Neville?" Elysia asked, once Snape had regained his composure.

"Aside from the fact that he's a bigger lab safety hazard than Seamus 'Sparky' Finnegan?" Snape said, with a grimace. "All I could think when I looked at him was, 'why couldn't _he_ have been the Prophecy Child?' And then I felt guilty for thinking that, and guilt and self-loathing lead to a rather unpleasant place."

He sighed. "You and I, we have a lot in common, Potter. Elysia. We both grew up abused, neglected... unloved. Looking back, it was so obvious, and I could kick myself for ignoring the signs. It warps you, makes you think horrible things are normal." He looked at her with haunted eyes.

She gazed back, eyes just as haunted. "It does. And it never really goes away, does it? The scars. The doubts. That endless refrain of 'what did I do to deserve this?'"

Lily was silently weeping. 

"You've changed, Elysia," Snape said. "Transition aside, you carry yourself differently. Like you know your own worth. And not in an over-compensating way; it's as if many of those scars have healed, much more than they ought to have in just a few short months."

Elysia sat silently, gathering her thoughts, then snorted. "Honestly, they were an eternity from my perspective. Janet?" She called.

"Hi!" Janet said, popping into existence in the middle of the sunken living room. Her chipper demeanor was a sharp contrast to the somber mood of everyone else, and Elysia found it to be a welcome relief.

"Janet," Elysia said, lip twitching with a repressed grin, "can you explain to Professor Snape how I'm no longer the hot mess I was last term?"

Janet smirked, locking eyes with Snape. "In short? We cheated like mad." A book appeared in her hand, which she passed to Snape.

"_Processing Trauma,_" he read. Opening the book, his eyes widened and he finished reading the entire volume in a matter of minutes.

"How?" He gasped as he closed the book. "It's as if I've undergone _decades_ of therapy!"

"There's more to mind magics than legilimency and occlumency, Professor," Elysia said. "Wasn't sure this would work, though, no matter what Janet said." She shot Janet a look, at which Janet stuck out her tongue.

"Of course it worked!" Janet said. "We had all the time in the world to make sure of it."

"Oh, by the way, d'you want that tattoo of yours removed?"

"You can do that? Yes, please!"

"_Lotu askatu!_"



+++++



"One last thing, Russ," Lily said. "That prophecy? The one you overheard, that caused Albus to ruin so many lives? Trelawney faked it because she thought it'd get her hired."

"_WHAT!?_"



+++++



Upon returning to the real world only a scant few minutes after entering her mindscape, Elysia made her way to dinner as Professor Snape finished squaring away his classroom. She caught up with Ron and Hermione at the doors to the Great Hall.

"What'd Snape want?" Ron asked.

Elysia thought for a moment. "Honestly? I think he had a bit of an identity crisis seeing me not looking like my dad anymore. Anyway, we cleared the air a bit."

"Think you can clear the *way* a bit, while you're at it?" Malfoy's voice drawled from behind them. "Some of us would like dinner."

"Shove off, Malfoy," Ron started, stepping towards him.

"Ron --" Elysia started, even as she and Hermione stepped out of the doorway. But it was too late, Malfoy and Ron were already hurling insults and ignoring everyone else.

"Honestly, those two," Hermione muttered to her, rolling her eyes.

"Right? They're like sodium and water," Elysia replied. "You'd think their flirting would've moved past tugging on each other's pig-tails by now," she added, rather more loudly.

Hermione burst out laughing, even as both Ron and Malfoy shot her a dirty look.

"And anyway," Ron said, turning back to Malfoy, "at least *my* dad's not in the paper for being an evil git! Does you mum prefer him as a glorified lawn ornament, or as dementor chow? My bet's the statue -- probably the only time it's gotten hard since she had you!"

Ron had clearly gone too far. With an inarticulate growl, Malfoy pounced on him, knocking them both to the floor, scattering students in their wake as they wrestled around.

"Here now, what's all this? Break it up, you two!" Professor Moody came down the stairs. The boys ignored him, so with a grunt he drew his wand and cast a stream of pale blue spell-fire at them. Elysia's glasses identified it as a free-form human-to-animal transfiguration, and sure enough when the light faded they saw two long, furry creatures, still locked in combat. One had white fur, the other red.

"Break it up, I said!" Professor Moody waved his wand again, and the two creatures began bouncing up and down on the floor of the Entrance Hall, exactly as if Moody were dribbling a basketball.

"Alastor!" Professor McGonagall shouted, dashing down the stairs towards them. "What in Merlin's name are you doing?"

"Teaching," Moody answered, still focusing on the two bouncing creatures.

"Are those *students!?*" McGonagall shrieked, launching into a rant about the proper way to discipline students, which was apparently _not this._

As Moody's distraction caused the bouncing to let up, Elysia and Hermione scooped up the creatures and petted them soothingly on the back. "Aww, you're so much more pleasant like this," Elysia cooed to the white ferret she was holding.

"Maybe we should ask Professor McGonagall to leave them like this for awhile," Hermione suggested with a smirk. 

The white one actually seemed to relax somewhat at that, but the red one started wriggling frantically and making an odd growling noise.

"Ugh, stop squirming! Okay, _fine,_ Ron!" Hermione said exasperatedly, setting him down.

"It's easier sometimes, not having to be a person, right?" Elysia murmured to the unexpectedly-relaxed white ferret. "Nobody expects anything from you. Life is simpler."

The little fur-ball looked up at her, surprise showing clearly even on its ferrety face.

"Maybe you should give some thought to what _you_ want from your life," she continued, scritching the ferret behind the ears, "and not just what everyone _expects_ of you. Life might suck less. Or, you won't have to pretend to be someone you're not as often, which I think counts. Worked for me, at least. Anyway," Elysia said, setting the ferret down, "time to get changed back. But think about what I said, yeah?"

The ferret looked at her for a long moment, then scampered over to where McGonagall was waving her wand over the red-furred weasel.
