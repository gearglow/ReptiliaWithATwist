# The List

## Summary

Harry is a trans girl, and ends up in the Afterlife (which looks suspiciously like The Good Place). The usual Reptilia28 challenge ensues, with a twist or two.

### Reptilia28 Challenge Details

> Harry is killed at 17 during the fight with Voldemort. He's sent to his Death's office (explained later) and finds out that this isn't the first time that this has happened.
>
> Harry's Death (who can have a human  name) is mad at his arrival. Apparently, people dying before their time is a black mark on the various Deaths' records, and Harry is getting  perilously close to getting this particular one fired.
>
> When Harry asks what was supposed to have happened, Death goes off on a rant saying how he was supposed to have killed Voldemort, found his soulmate ("Some Granger girl…") and lived to be a centennial age.  But since Harry keeps getting into life-threatening situations for one reason or another, he keeps dying before that happens. Harry is surprised about the soul mate part.
> Death gives Harry a paper to sign that allows him to retain his memories (the previous times, he wasn't given this option for some reason). Harry is deposited to a previous time of the writer's choosing.
> Eventually, Harry gets it right. He kills Voldemort, gets the girl, and lives to a ripe old age of whatever. And Death doesn't get fired.
>
> REQUIREMENTS:
> Harry must have died at least three times before this one. The memory keeping contract must  be included. Death must refer to Hermione as "some Granger girl" when Harry's soul mate turns up in his rant. Obviously, must at least be Harmony.
>
> OPTIONAL: Dumbledore's manipulations can be a factor in Harry's premature demises."

### Changes and Adjustments

> + Make A Wish: What if Harry really was just that good?
>+ Can't keep timeline memories, but can train up in the afterlife and keep that. 
>   + Training includes mind magics 
>+ Can make a plan with whichever advisors are desired. The plan lives in Harry's mindscape and can only be accessed during occlumentic meditation.
>+ Death (Eleanor?) grants a boon: limited precognition so Harry (almost) always sees a direct attack coming far enough in advance to counter it. This might just be on an instinctive level, or it might go so far as to be a full-blown vision, depending on the attack.
>+ No way is Eleanor getting fired, but she's a romantic at heart (and *really* wants to hook up with Destiny if she can help her latest pet project along).

## Chapter 1: Making Memories

### ?????	????/??/??	??:??

The first thing Harry saw was a white wall with green letters, which said, *Welcome! Everything is fine.*

*That's nice,* Harry thought. *I wonder where I am, though?* The room looked like a generic waiting room in a generic office, with a generic sofa facing the wall with its soothing message.

*For that matter,* Harry thought, *how did I get here? The last thing I remember was... Voldemort. And the Forbidden Forest, and a green light... He spouted some cliché monologue, too. What was it again? Oh, right. "Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived. Come to die."* Something about that line made Harry very uncomfortable, but she couldn't quite... wait a minute. *She!?*

"... Oh." Harry looked down at herself, and realized that for the first time she felt comfortable in her own skin.

Of course, the fact that she was wearing clothes that actually *fit* for once didn't hurt either.

A door opened off to the left, and a voice startled her out of her reverie.

"Ms. Potter? We're ready for you."



+++++



"Harry? Hi, I'm Eleanor," the blonde behind the desk said. "Have a seat and we'll get started."

Harry sat. The chair was surprisingly comfy.

Eleanor opened a folder on the desk, which Harry didn't think was there a second ago.

"So. First things first. You, Harry James Potter, are dead."

Harry sat up with a start. "Wait, what?"

Eleanor stared across the desk with an amused quirk of the eyebrow. "Again. You've died kind of a lot, huh? Not that it's really your fault. Your enemies cheat like my ex. This time they even got you to walk right into a Killing Curse, voluntarily. Not your best moment, though you *did* score major points for selflessness. Or, you would have, if it had made any difference at all. Sorry, kid, your heroic sacrifice was for nothin'."

Harry's jaw dropped. "You mean Voldemort *won!?*" She buried her face in her hands and growl-screamed into them.

"'Fraid so, kiddo. But don't worry! We got that horcrux out of you and you're in the Good Place now. Well, for the moment."

Harry looked up, hands still poised in case of further bouts of screaming. "For the moment?"

Eleanor sighed, and slapped her hands on the desk. "Look, kid, I'm going to level with you. Most people, they kick the bucket, show up here or " -- she blew a raspberry and gave a thumbs-down -- "the Bad Place, work through a few Purgatory cycles, and move on. You're not most people. You got whammied by Destiny, so you get to go back and try again until you get whatever Destiny has in store for you out of the way." 

Harry put her face back in her hands and growl-screamed again.

Eleanor flipped through the folder. "Lessee here. Ooh, tough break, kid," she winced. "Destiny's kind of cruel sometimes. Don't tell her I said that, though; still trying to get her to hook up with me. She can *rock* that LBD, y'know what I'm sayin'?" She winked in exaggerated fashion.

Harry snorted into her hands and looked up with a surprised giggle.

"Anyway," Eleanor continued, "that Vole-dee-mort guy. Sounds like a rodent. Ya gotta *exterminate* him before you can get to the good stuff, which means *you* get to go back. Again. Geez, what is this, your twelfth time?"

Harry shrugged. "I don't remember."

"Oh, right, that whole wipe-your-memory-so-you-don't-break-spacetime thing." Eleanor groused. "Sorry about that. Not my call. I'm just filling in for Michael this go-round," she continued, *sotto voce.* "Poor guy gets a little stir-crazy every few Beremies."

Finally starting to relax, Harry settled back into her chair again. "So, um..." she started. "What's next? Actually, wait. First, why am I a girl? Or, why was I a guy? Or... whatever." She waved a hand vaguely. "Not that I'm complaining now, but what the *fork?*" Her eyes widened. "Fork? Why can't I say 'fork?'"

Eleanor grinned. "Yeah, that's from the first draft of the Good Place. We all thought it was funny, so it kind of just stuck around. And you've always been a girl, Harry. You just never got the chance to show it back on Earth. Blame Bumblesnore, or whatever his name is, for that. Devious little shirt was worse than that Vole guy, in some ways." She flipped through the folder again. "Wow, what a jerk! Talked you into eating that AK, left you to rot in Durzkaban, kept all *kinds* of secrets from you, potioned up you and your potential soul-mates to keep you apart -- especially that Granger girl." She looked up, eyes blazing. "Sean's going to have a *field day* with him."

"Hermione?" Harry blurted. "*She's* my soul-mate?"

"*Potential* soul-mate. You've run across a couple, looks like. It really just means that you're super-compatible and you *get* each other. Or *can,* eventually. Looks like that Lovegood girl's another one."

"*Luna!?*" Harry squeaked.

"Yup!" Eleanor chirped. "Ooh, and they're both potentials for each other, too. How's *that* for good luck?" She winked at Harry again, and waggled her eyebrows outrageously.

Harry blushed beet-red. "I... I... Um..."

"Woah, easy there, Beyoncé," Eleanor grinned.

Harry just looked confused.

"Beyoncé? Like, Destiny's Child? Because you're a Child of Destiny?"

Harry looked even more confused, somehow. Eleanor sighed. "Jeez, kid, get a radio."

Harry shook her head. Pulling herself together finally, she asked, "So, what, I need to go back, kill the Dark Plonker once and for all, get the girl -- girls? -- *be* a girl, and live to a ripe old age? How am I supposed to do that if I keep forgetting everything every time I go back?"

Eleanor thought for a minute, then grinned. "Janet!"



+++++



Janet, it turned out, was a hyper-evolved sentient interface to the sum total of all knowledge in the universe, and an absolute sweetheart too. Between the three of them, a plan was soon formed.

"Just sign here, here, and here," Janet said, handing Harry a contract. "This should keep the Judge happy. It says that, while you won't remember your last life, you can keep your training from here in the Good Place in your subconscious, and a plan of action in your occlumency mindscape. Basically, you'll get mind magic training first, and everything after that gets tucked away in the mindscape you'll build as part of that. You'll still have any instincts and muscle memory that result from any training you do here, and the actual knowledge will come to you if you focus on it. But you won't really remember your time here, or anything like that. Just your training, and not as lived experience. It might feel weird at first when you go back."

Harry smiled nervously. "It's better than going back blind like before, I suppose."

"Right?" Eleanor said. "Well! That's settled. Let's get to it! Janet made a sweet little place for you to train, and... 'live,' I guess? I mean, you're dead, but..."

"The word you're looking for is 'reside,' Eleanor," Janet interjected with a smile.

"Thanks, babe," Eleanor said. "Anyway, she named it Elysium after some ancient Greek idea of a hero's afterlife. Seemed fitting."



+++++



"This. Is. Awesome!" Harry gushed, looking around her own personal Elysium. There was a cozy-looking cottage, some lightly-forested grounds at the edge of a crystal-clear lake, and a *quidditch pitch!* The lake had a small cabana on its beach, a fire pit next to some log benches, and a few large boulders perfect for sunning or diving. The grounds had a large grassy clearing, with a perfectly round border of white stone.

Janet had a smug smile, and Eleanor was grinning like a Cheshire cat. "Wait 'til you see the inside!"

They walked into the cottage and Harry *squealed.*

"Oh Merlin, it's *wonderful!*"

The door opened into a main room with a sunken den area, ringed with squashy sofas, facing a hearth with several hooks on swiveling arms mounted to one side. Through one doorway was a roomy, well-appointed kitchen with plenty of counter space, and through another was a huge, well-lit study, with shelves and shelves of books, big bay windows with reading nooks, a large desk, and several squashy armchairs. A door in the kitchen turned out to be a staircase down to a basement workshop, with fully-appointed potions and enchanting areas. Last there was a door across the den area which led to a large bedroom with a king-size four-poster bed, with French doors opening onto a deck facing the lake. Across from the French doors was a bathroom with a sunken jacuzzi tub. The whole place had a cozy, rustic aesthetic which Harry found thoroughly comforting.

"I should hope so," Janet said. "I got it from your past lives' daydreams about having a place of your own. With a few modifications for the training you'll be undertaking, of course."

"Oh, right. About that," Harry said. "What's the plan?"

Janet and Eleanor looked at each other and grinned.

"Montage?"

"Montage."



+++++



Time, such as it was in the Afterlife, passed in a blur. (And frequently with an '80s rock-inspired backing track, courtesy of Janet.)

It wasn't all training, either. Since it *was* the Afterlife, after all, Harry could meet with other dead people. She got to train with some of the greatest witches and wizards who ever lived, and several mundane masters as well. But she also got to spend time with her parents. 

James and Lily were both brilliant, though each had their specialties. And it turned out that both were brilliant flyers, both on a broom and without. One of the perks of being dead, apparently, was that gravity was more of a suggestion than an actual law. Not to mention animagus training; while neither James nor Lily had flight-capable forms, Harry was a peregrine falcon. Because of course she was. Lily named the form Nemesis, after the Greek goddess of retribution.

And speaking of shape-shifting, Harry was also a latent metamorphmagus. The overnight hair-growth incident after a bad haircut during Harry's childhood had been an unmistakable sign, if only anyone had known to look. Oh, she wasn't nearly as innately talented at it as, say, Tonks, but the possibility was there, and so she was trained in that too. This, coupled with her animagus training, of course led to some interesting possibilities which were thoroughly explored.

She trained in mental magic, myriad styles of martial arts and dueling, melee weapons, archery, firearms, spell-crafting, wandless magic, wards, enchanting, engineering, math, science, logic, rhetoric, deportment, politics, history, and many *many* other subjects. Her tutors crammed her brain full of every last bit of knowledge, skill, and instinct they thought could possibly be beneficial. If she hadn't already been dead, she felt, it might've killed her all over again.

Eventually, after a time impossible to quantify by mortal standards, she was ready.



## Chapter 2: Keep In Mind

### #4 Privet Drive, Surrey	1994/06/26	04:30

Harry woke with a start. 

Fading moonlight streamed through the window, making the sleeping Hedwig's feathers glow softly. 

Checking the time on the battered old alarm clock Dudley had thrown against the wall one morning because he hadn't wanted to get up for school, Harry saw that it was still a couple of hours before sunrise. Hogwarts had let out only yesterday, and normally he slept like the dead that first night back.

Wait, *'he?'* Why did that feel so much more uncomfortable than usual?

A sudden headache stabbed his brain all over, and he fell back to the mattress with a groan.

"Hi, I'm Janet!"

"Aagh!" Harry yelped, jolting upright. She looked around in a confused panic. *Wait, 'she?'*

She found herself sprawled on an almost unnaturally green lawn, with a rustic-looking cottage to one side and a lake-side cabana to the other. Standing over her was a pretty brunette with a clipboard.

Harry scrambled to her feet as the brunette -- Janet, presumably -- continued speaking. "Welcome to your mindscape, your own personal Elysium!"

"We -- we're in my mind?" Harry asked.

"Yup!" Janet chirped. "And I'm a personification of your subconscious. Walk with me, Harry." She started towards the cottage. "Long story short, you died. Again. We decided to give you an edge on your next life through, and all this" -- she waved vaguely around at the cottage they'd just entered -- "is part of that." She sat primly on one of the squashy sofas near the hearth and patted the seat next to her.

Harry sat. "So... why am I a girl here?"

"We're in *your* head, Harry. You tell me," Janet answered.

"... Oh. Huh. That explains a lot, I guess. So I'm dead?"

"No, not anymore, Harry," Janet replied. "You got sent back to get it right this time. You can't remember the past lives, though, because it would destroy the space-time continuum, so we sort of *cheated.* A little bit."

Harry raised an eyebrow.

"It's all here," Janet continued. "You left yourself a to-do list and some pointers. Most of the training-specific stuff is tucked away in your subconscious, tied to specific triggers; we didn't want to overwhelm you. But there are a couple of things you need to know up front."

"Like that I'm a girl?" Harry asked.

"No, that one was going to bubble up around this time in your life regardless. Puberty, don'tcha know. So we tied this first mindscape entrance to that realization as a trigger, since thanks to your between-lives training you can do something about it now."

"Really?" Harry said. A cold prickling sensation washed over her scalp. "Wait, don't tell me. I'm a shape-shifter, right?"

Janet stood with a smile. "Pretty much! Come on, it's time to show you the study."

They went down the hallway to a huge room filled with books, expansive bay windows with cozy-looking reading nooks, a substantial desk, and a floor safe tucked away in a corner. A black leather binder was sitting on the desk. Janet gestured to it. "Here's the list! It's full of useful foreknowledge, but you'll only be able to read the parts you can act on or already know about at any given time. Too much future knowledge cam mess you up. Your last self said it wouldn't do to have you too far out of sync with your peers, after all; you're too isolated as it is."

Harry nodded and opened the binder.

"The primers contain the sum total of knowledge and training from your past life on that subject," Janet said. "You and your advisors decided the first order of business was a degree of independence, so everything on this first list is to make you more capable of fending for yourself without setting off the Trace or relying on the adults in your life who have proven less than helpful."

"Dobby, huh?" Harry said. "Why didn't I think of that?"

"You did," Janet smirked. "Anyway, as the personification of your subconscious, I can dig up anything in your mind you ask me to, unless there's a good reason not to. If that's the case, I'll tell you so."

"Thanks, Janet," Harry smiled.

Janet waved a hand, and a pile of books appeared next to one of the reading nooks. Harry spent the next little while flipping through them, realizing that far more knowledge was pouring into her mind than was written on the page. By the time she was finished with the first book, she understood why.

> To Do
>
> - ~~Find and read the primer on Mind Magic~~

"Bloody hell!" Harry exclaimed. "What a rush!"

"Wait 'til you read the next set,'" Janet grinned.

Harry dove right in, with a fervor that would have put Hermione Granger to shame.

"Woah," Harry said when she finally came up for air. "I know kung fu."

Janet placed a steadying hand on Harry's shoulder. "Now, remember, you don't have the physical or magical development yet to take full advantage of all you've just learned. Go slowly at first."

Harry nodded, with a huge grin on her face. "That's what the training regimen is for, yeah?"

Janet nodded. "You'll want to take care of the Gringotts business first, so you and Dobby can get any equipment you'll need."

"Gotcha."

Harry dove back in.

> To Do
>
> - ~~Find and read the primers on Goblins, House Elves, Public Speaking, Negotiation, and Finance~~

"The sun's coming up, Harry," Janet said as Harry finished the last of the books. 

"What, barely? I've been here for hours!" Harry exclaimed. "Wait, I remember now. Time's different in a mind-scape, isn't it?"

"It is," Janet confirmed. "But that's all the books on that first list, so I'd say we timed things out rather well, wouldn't you?"

"You -- I -- we *timed* this? Merlin!"

"He helped."

"I.... sort of remember that?" Harry said hesitantly. "Like a dream, almost."

"You weren't allowed to keep most of your memories of the afterlife," Janet said. "Some of them, yes, such as that needed to effectively use your training, and a few of the people you trained with. Merlin, Morgana, Bruce Lee, the Founders... you'll remember bits and pieces, especially if it becomes relevant, but the only clear memories you were allowed to keep were of your parents."

"My... my parents?" Harry stammered.

"Go look in the bedroom," Janet replied with a soft smile.



+++++



The bedroom, it turned out, was empty. The deck beyond the French doors, however, was not.

"Mum? Dad?" Harry choked out, rushing to the deck.

James and Lily Potter turned and engulfed their child in a crushing hug.

Eventually, Harry pulled herself together. "You... aren't really here, are you? You're just personifications of my afterlife memories of you?"

"Pretty much," James shrugged. But there're a lot of those. Enough for us to *effectively* be here for you in Elysium, your mindscape, even if the real us can't be. Those versions of us are watching over you, though. You can be sure of that."

"We're so proud of you, honey!" Lily cried, squeezing Harry again. Harry squeezed back.

A trickle of memories crawled over Harry's scalp, helping to temper her emotions at seeing her parents again. *For the first time in this lifetime,* her memories whispered, *but not the last. They're right here!* She squeezed them one last time. "I guess it's time to get things moving," she said.

Her parents nodded, her dad with a devilish grin and her mom with a decidedly Slytherin smirk. "They won't know what hit them, Nemesis," Lily said.

James patted her on the back. "Go get 'em, kiddo!'"



## Chapter 3: Ellie and Robbie

Opening her eyes with a start, Harry looked down at herself. She was in boy-mode again; as uncomfortable as it was, she knew she would have to stay boy-shaped for awhile. All the more reason to get some independence, she supposed.

She went through her morning routine, including the silent treatment at breakfast with the Dursleys, then dug out her Gringotts key and money pouch and headed to the park down Wisteria Walk. Tucking herself away among a cluster of bushes, she called out softly, "Dobby!"

With a quiet *pop,* Dobby the House-Elf appeared. "Great Harry Potter Sir is calling for Dobby!" He gushed, bowing so low that his long, floppy ears brushed the ground.

"Dobby," Harry said, "How would you like to be my elf?"

Dobby nodded frantically, so overcome he could only squeak.

"Dobby, I claim you as my elf," Harry said, remembering the formal oath from her earlier reading. "My magic to your magic, my strength to your strength, my knowledge to your knowledge, my secrets to your secrets. Henceforth, you shall be known as a Potter elf. And as a part of my family," Harry added, though this wasn't in the formal oath. "So mote it be!"

A soft glow surrounded the two for a moment, and as it faded Dobby leapt to embrace Harry.

"*Family* to the Great Harry Potter! And so much *knowledge!* Dobby is... *overwhelmed!*"

Harry hugged back and smiled. "Me too, Dobby. We're going to really shake things up together, you and I."

"Great Harry Potter Miss has plans?"

Harry thought for a second. "First, Dobby, nobody else knows I'm a girl yet, and I want to keep it that way for now. Just call me Harry. We *are* family now, after all."

Dobby nodded, tears in his eyes and a smile on his face.

"Second," Harry continued, "I know that your speech patterns are because of your time with the Malfoys, but you're part of the Potter family now. You're not a servant, not a lesser being. You are Dobby Potter, and as such you're expected to stand tall and speak with confidence."

"I understand, Harry," Dobby said.

"I'm still working on that myself," Harry mused with a smile. "We can help each other out on that, yeah?"

"Okay," Dobby agreed.

"Thanks, Dobby. Now, I've got some plans for today. I want to end the day with more independence than I started it with, and the next step is to see what resources we have. So we're off to Gringotts," Harry said. "What do you think is the best way to do this? The Knight Bus, maybe?"

"Dobby can -- err, *I* can bring you straight to Gringotts, Harry. We elves has -- *have* our own kind of magic. Like apparition, only not, you see."

"That sounds good," Harry replied. "Shall we?" 

Dobby wrapped Harry in a hug, and they were off to Diagon Alley.

> To Do
>
> - ~~Bind Dobby as your house elf~~

+++++

They reappeared with a *pop* in a cordoned-off section of the Gringotts lobby, and Dobby immediately dragged Harry over to one of the lines. "So the next person doesn't be landing on you," he said. After a short wait, they got to a teller, who glared down at them from the abnormally high counter.

"Yes?" The goblin asked, in a rather put-out voice.

"May blood and gold flow at your feet. I'd like a full accounting of my holdings, please," Harry said.

"Key?" The goblin said shortly.

Harry handed over the key. The goblin took it and did something behind the counter, then handed it back. "Lockjaw will take you to an account manager. Lockjaw!"

Another goblin, Lockjaw presumably, led them through an opulent door into a maze of opulent hallways. Eventually, they came to another opulent door, which Lockjaw led them through before ducking back out.

Another goblin, built like a gnarled old oak tree with a bushy white beard, was seated behind a desk, with a gas-lamp and several ledgers on it. He gestured to the chairs in front of the desk and introduced himself. "I am Claymore, the account manager for the Potter estate. I wasn't expecting you for a few more years, Mr. Potter."

Harry inwardly cringed at being addressed as 'Mr.' but shrugged it off. *Not yet,* she told herself. "Harry is fine, Claymore," she told the goblin. "May this meeting bring profits to our clans and ruin to our enemies." So saying, she had a seat in one chair and gestured for Dobby to take the other. "This is Dobby, my friend and advisor."

"Well met, Harry, Dobby. What brings you to Gringotts today?"

"I recently came to the conclusion that I have been far too reactive in my life thus far, and have decided to do something about it. The first step, then, is to take stock. So my first order of business is a full accounting of my available assets. Depending on the results, we'll go from there."

Claymore nodded and, after digging around in a desk drawer for a moment, produced a small, ornate stiletto dagger; a roll of parchment; a small screw-top inkwell; and a red quill. "Well then, Harry, what say we start with a lineage trace?" He screwed the inkwell onto the dagger's hilt and gestured for the back of Harry's hand. After passing the blade through the gas-lamp's flame several times, he gently slid the point into a vein. The stiletto blade, it turned out, was hollow, and Harry's blood began to fill the inkwell. 

Once it filled, Harry shifted the wound closed. Claymore blinked at this, but said nothing. Unscrewing the inkwell once more, he made some gestures with the dagger over the quill, dipped it into the inkwell full of Harry's blood, and set it on the now-unrolled parchment.

It began to draw quite rapidly, and after a few minutes, Harry could see a family tree. When it finished, Claymore waved the dagger over the inkwell and quill and the blood vanished. He placed everything but the parchment back in the drawer and gestured Harry closer.

"Well now, let's see... Hmm. No real surprises here... Oh! Seems you're in the line of succession for the House of Black. Well, no bearing on anything for today. One moment, I'll have a clerk bring the most recent statements."

Claymore knocked on a bronze pipe which was sticking out of the wall, then yelled something into it in Gobbledegook. Thanks to the Primer on Goblins Harry had read in Elysium that morning, she found that she understood most of it. It seemed that Lockjaw was Claymore's apprentice, and had been sent to Records for the requested statements. *Huh,* she thought to herself. *Hadn't realized I'd picked up Gobbledegook. Wonder what else I don't know that I know?*

Lockjaw entered the room a few minutes later, handed over a folder, and left again.

The rest of the folder was fine-print regarding the farm and business, but what caught Harry's attention (aside from the sheer amount) was that note about personal effects. *Perhaps something of my parents'?* Catching Claymore's attention, she asked, "Claymore, a couple of things have caught my attention. First, the portkey to the property at Red Wharf. Am I able to request use of that now, or do I need to wait until I come of age?"

"Well, I don't suppose there's any harm in you going to look at the place," he replied, "but ownership doesn't transfer to you until you come of age. Still, might be a good idea to be able to plan for it."

"Thank you, Claymore. I'd like to schedule that for tomorrow, then. And second," she continued, "do I have access to the storage vault yet, or only the trust vault? I'd like to examine the personal effects."

"You are indeed able to access that vault. I gather you'd like to do so today?"

"Once we're finished here, please. One last thing - I note that there is a significant amount of liquid assets in the main vault which are not being put to work. Is there anything we can do about that right now?"

"Very astute for one so young," Claymore nodded in approval. "Unfortunately, as far as the law is concerned, investment counts as withdrawal, so until you reach your majority neither you nor your guardians can do anything with it. Pity. That was mostly old Fleamont's proceeds from selling off his potions company when he retired. James, your father, never had a chance to do anything with it either. That money's been sitting idle for more than 15 years by now."

"How about the trust vault? What can you do with, say, 25,000 galleons? Something with aggressive earning potential, I'd hope. At, oh, 40% commission? That should leave enough interest income for discretionary spending, too."

"Now you're speaking my language, lad!" Claymore laughed. "Any particulars, or shall I use my best judgement?"

"I think we understand each other, Claymore. You'd know better than I what opportunities there are at present."

"I can think of a few, lad," Claymore said. "Magical only, or muggle as well?"

"Either or both, I should think," Harry said. "Which reminds me, I'll need to withdraw from my trust vault, and change a fair bit to pounds, at some point today."

"Aye, we'll get Lockjaw to take care of you, lad. Anything else?"

"No sir. Thank you for all your help today. May your enemies cower before you and your coffers never empty."

"Same to you, lad, same to you. Lockjaw!"



+++++



Lockjaw took Harry and Dobby much further down on the minecart than she'd been before. By the time they stopped, she could see the end of the tracks in the distance.

"Vault fifteen, Potter Storage Vault," Lockjaw announced. He hopped out of the cart, Harry and Dobby following, and stroked one long finger down the door. The door opened with a puff of green smoke, and the two entered. Lockjaw stayed at the entrance, unfolding a comfortable chair from seemingly nowhere and relaxing into it.

The vault looked like the back room of an antique shop. Furniture was stacked in one corner, bookshelves filled with books in another. Racks of portraits were next to a stack of trunks and several cabinets and credenzas. Rugs and tapestries lay rolled in piles along one wall. Each item had a small parchment tag attached. Next to the door was a roll of parchment with a list of tag designators matched to descriptions of the tagged items.

Dobby snagged the list and the two went over it for a bit, deciding what to focus on. While the folder Claymore had given them listed *what* was in the vault, there was so much that actually finding anything in particular took some doing.

The first thing Harry examined were the trunks. Most of them were the standard Hogwarts 'Firstie' trunk, but there were a few with substantial enhancements. A couple were even listed as "residential" trunks, which, when Harry opened them, turned out to contain an entire house's-worth of rooms inside. 

"Dobby, come look at this and tell me what you think," Harry called. She'd found that one of the residential trunks was made of *lignum vitae* of all things, which, according to the primer on Enchanting she'd devoured this morning, meant it could handle a much larger amount of magic without overloading. It also seemed to have a rather sizable runestone locus, though she couldn't find the stone that should have been inside. With no runestones, the interior of the trunk defaulted to a 10ft^3^ room, containing only the locus pedestal and the ladder out.

"D'you think," she continued, "that a trunk like this could handle a dueling chamber without burning out?"

Dobby squinted at it, then climbed down to examine the locus pedestal more closely. Climbing back out, he nodded. "A smallish one. Enough for three, maybe four people casting at once. More would be too much for the thaumic bleed-off rate."

"And maybe a smallish apartment, and a workshop, along with?"

"Oh, easily, Harry! Capacity is not a problem with this trunk."

Harry nodded. "I guess we're taking it with us today, then! We'll have to pick up a new control stone before we leave the Alley. Now, what about some of this furniture?"

In the end, they'd managed to find enough furniture to outfit a small two-bedroom apartment; journals from James, Lily, and both of James' parents; several volumes of Potter Family grimoires; Lily's old textbooks, along with her reference library; some House Potter elf uniforms (one of which Dobby promptly exchanged for his current garb); and several articles of clothing that looked to be close enough in size for Harry to shift herself into a perfect fit without it being obvious. The dragon-hide boots and matching jackets (a set each of Ukrainian Ironbelly and Hebridean Black) were a particularly nice find, and even had resizing charms worked into them. Harry decided to change out of Dudley's cast-offs before they continued their errands, and ducked into the trunk.

She emerged wearing close-fitting jeans, a black v-neck t-shirt, and the Ironbelly boots and jacket. She'd also shifted her hair into a rakish mop, making the usual messy bird's nest look intentional. In all, she felt comfortably androgynous. It wasn't quite as feminine as she'd've liked, but she felt far better than before.

"What do you think, Dobby?" She asked, spinning around.

"Very nice!" Dobby exclaimed.

*Now what was next on the list?* She thought. Dropping into Elysium for a second, she recalled the list in the binder. There was something new on the list, though upon reflection she'd already known about it.

> To Do
>
> - ~~Take the Knight Bus to Gringotts ASAP and get a full accounting~~
> - Outfit the trunk as a proper living and training space (inc. foodstuffs and utensils)
>
> - Establish a training regimen (see Appendix A)

The trunk had a few convenience enchantments which were standard for most high-end magical luggage. Self-shrinking, featherlight, and so forth. As such, once they'd gathered everything they wanted to bring from the vault during this trip, Harry shrank the trunk and slipped it into a pocket.

"Thank you for indulging us, Lockjaw," Harry said as they exited the vault.

They proceeded to Harry's trust vault, where Harry gathered a stack of 1,500 galleons with Dobby's help. Once back at the main floor, they bade Lockjaw farewell and stood in line to change half of the galleons to pound notes.

Back in Diagon Alley proper, it was time to find a replacement runestone. Harry and Dobby wandered down the main thoroughfare of Diagon Alley, chattering to each other about the shops they passed. In a luggage shop, Harry bought them both charmed bookbags which had an Undetectable Extension charm on them, as well as featherlight and durability charms. The proprietor also directed them to a shop up the Alley past Gringotts, where Harry picked up a variety of blank runestones and a high-end rune-carving kit. Stopping in at an apothecary, Harry purchased a stock of medical potions, expecting to need them after the intense training she was planning. She also picked up a stock of nutrient potions to help make up for her years of malnutrition, and enough ingredients to stock a potions lab.

Finally, finished with the magical shopping, they decided to head into the Muggle world. Stepping out of the Leaky Cauldron, but still within the pub's wards, Harry shifted into proper girl-form, with longer auburn hair. She looked around for Dobby, and found instead a boy who could've been her twin brother. He had hair the same auburn as hers, though cut in a shorter, more boyish style. He was even wearing a similar outfit.

"Wha- Dobby? Is that you?" Harry yelped.

"We're in the muggle world now," Dobby replied. "House-elves mustn't be seen by muggles. I borrowed your shifting magic through the house-elf bond. Does Dobby -- er, *do I* look OK?"

"You look *brilliant,* Dobby! You could be my brother, like that! Well, we *are* family now," Harry answered. "Although, 'Dobby' is kind of an odd name for a muggle. Maybe I should call you something else? How do you feel about 'Robbie?'"

"Could... could you call me that anyway?" Robbie asked. "I'm a proud Potter elf now, and I need a name to fit."

"Robbie it is, then!" Harry said. "Hmm. I suppose I can't really answer to 'Harry' like this, either. Can't wait to be rid of that name for good, but for now..." She sighed, leaning against the wall of the pub. "Wish there was some clue from Elysium."

"Elysiu- oh, your mindscape?" Robbie asked.

"Yeah, there's all kinds of ideas kicking around in there," she replied absently. "Wait, that's it! 'Elysia!' Robbie, you're a genius!" She spun him around in a hug. "Just call me 'Ellie' for short!"

And so Ellie and Robbie set off down Charing Cross Road.

## Chapter 4: Harmony

After a quick stop for lunch, the two wandered the shops for the rest of the afternoon. Elysia managed to find a full set of free-weights and some gym mats, as well as both a heavy bag and a speed-bag. Gloves were a non-issue as she could simply shift them into place as needed.

They also found more clothes. Both Elysia and Robbie were reveling in the ability to wear what they wanted to for once. Robbie, in particular, had a *penchánt* for socks with loud patterns, while Elysia enjoyed more form-fitting apparel after being saddled with horribly-oversized cast-offs all her life.

It also turned out that, thanks to her shifting ability, she no longer needed glasses. Since the world expected Harry Potter to wear them, though, she figured she might as well get some nice ones. Perhaps she could add enchantments at some point. She picked out some sunglasses with a classic look, and as they browsed at other stores, idly scratched runes in them with a fingernail shifted to a steel-hard point. She got as far as runes to darken automatically in bright sunlight, and turn clear in the shade, before they were done shopping.

Lastly, they picked up kitchenware and several appliances, bedding, curtains, and the rest of the little things that make a house feel more like a home. And after a final stop at a grocer to stock their larders, Robbie popped them both back to Elysia's room #4 Privet Drive.

Robbie, having returned to his natural elf form, began moving the perishable goods into some of the stasis cupboards they'd found in the vault. Meanwhile, Elysia dug out one of the new runestones and the carving kit, and sat down at the dilapidated old desk under the window to start laying out the new configuration for the trunk.

It was late into the night before she was finished. Hedwig had returned from hunting all day and was snoozing, head tucked under one wing, on the perch near the window, before Elysia sat back and called Robbie over.

"What do you think, are we ready to pop this in?" She asked, gesturing to the runestone.

He leaned over it, muttering quietly under his breath, and then nodded. "I don't see any problems. I've gone over the trunk, and it's charged and ready."

"Thanks, Robbie," Elysia said, standing up and stretching. Between the two of them, they managed to get the runestone, which was roughly the size of the Dursley's big-screen TV, settled into the pedestal. The trunk's interior, which had started as an empty 10ft^3^ room, shifted around them.

When everything stopped moving, they found themselves still in a 10ft^3^ room, but the ladder was gone and there was a door in its place. One of the walls was taken up with several displays, showing the status of the trunk's various wards, power levels, air and water, and so on. Through the door was a spacious living room, with a stairwell leading up out of the trunk and an open kitchen separated by a cooktop island. A short hallway led to two bedroom suites, a study with a workshop area, and a spacious training room. The entire place was brightly lit by both an ambient *lumos* and large bay windows throughout. It wasn't exactly a mansion, but for the two of them it was more than comfortable.

The living area was piled high with all of the spoils from the day's errands, but between the two of them they made short work of it all. In less than an hour, everything was squared away, and they fell into their beds exhausted but delighted. It was, Elysia thought to herself as she drifted off, going to be the best summer ever.

### #4 Privet Drive, Surrey	1994/06/27	6:30

The next morning, after the usual morning ablutions and a quick breakfast of porridge, fresh fruit, and a nutrient potion, Elysia sat in the training room to meditate. After the initial grounding, centering, and contemplation of emptiness, she decided to pop into her mindscape.

"Hello!" Janet greeted her, as soon as she opened her eyes. She'd appeared back in the study. "Great work yesterday! Good use of resources, too. The bond with Dobby -- well, Robbie now, which is a very good thing -- anyway, *that* was unexpected."

Elysia raised an eyebrow. "Oh? What do you mean?"

Janet assumed a preparing-to-give-a-lecture pose. "If you recall, there is a formal oath to bind a house elf. You can think of this as the Bond of Agency, for reference. It makes the elf an agent of the House, so that it may act in service to the House. It does not make the elf a *member* of the House. When you added in the line about being part of the family, the nature of the bond changed. Instead of a Bond of Agency, it became a Bond of Brotherhood. While you both now act in the interests of House Potter -- especially as the last two members of House Potter -- there is no subservience. This is a bond of equals. As far as Magic is concerned, you two are siblings now. And thanks to the bond, you two will begin to instinctively act as siblings towards each other."

Elysia's eyes widened at that. "Woah! I have a brother!? This is so cool! I've always wanted a proper family..."

Janet smiled. "More than that, Ellie. The bond now acts more like a twin bond than a house-elf bond."

"Like the Weasley Twins?"

Janet nodded. "Just like that. A bit stronger, actually, thanks to how house-elf magic works. You can already share your subconscious knowledge library. You'll eventually be able to communicate telepathically, with enough practice, even without linking mindscapes."

"Wait, I can link mindscapes?"

Janet looked confused for a moment. "Oh, right, we weren't expecting this to come up yet. You weren't supposed to have to worry about symmetrical bonds like this until bonding with your soul-mates."

Elysia shook her head. "Wait, soul-*mates?* As in, more than one?"

"That's right," Janet replied. "You have two potential soul-mates that you are likely to meet in this phase of your life. It's not some mystical bond in and of itself; it just means that you're extremely compatible. You'll just *get* each other more easily. That said, that compatibility lends itself to certain kinds of magical bond-oaths. The most common is the magical Marriage Vows; most magical married couples can at least sense their partner's moods through this bond, although usually by the point that's even an option they've been able to read each other's body language well enough already."

"Okay, so are you saying that that's a lower end on the abilities of a bond like that?"

Janet smiled. "Exactly! Because of how in sync you are, there's less interference over the bond connection. That makes it more efficient, and so you can do more with that connection. Linking mindscapes is one of the more complex possibilities, as is sharing magic."

"Robbie did that with me yesterday."

"Yes, and that's a pretty common manifestation of a twin bond too. It all comes down to harmonics and thaumic resonance, really, for *any* bond. The more in-tune the ends are with each other, the better the connection."

"Okay, that's sounding like it's not limited to two people." Elysia said.

"It's not," Janet agreed. "There have been triad bonds, pack bonds, and House bonds before, for example. Obviously, the more people in the bond, the harder it is to get everyone in tune with each other, and therefore the less capable the bond becomes. Practically speaking, four is usually the upper limit for anything truly useful."

"That makes sense," Elysia said. "So, to compare this to light, or a radio, this is more about the frequency than the power?"

"You got it!" Janet exclaimed. "Power is more a function of your individual *internal* harmony. That's why magic is so heavily intent-based. The stronger your intent, the more *unified* you are in your intent, the more powerful your magic is. You should add the books about this to your list."

Elysia nodded. "I should just read them right now, honestly."

"I'll leave you to it, then," Janet replied, and vanished.

Elysia opened the binder on the desk.

> To Do
>
> - Find and read the primers on Math, Signal Processing, Bonds, and Soul Magic
> - Find and read the primer on Apparition
> - Establish a training regimen (see Appendix A)
> - Check out The Kiln at Red Wharf Bay

After Elysia finished off the primers, she cracked open Appendix A. She found a comprehensive training plan, covering calisthenics, free-weights, cardio, flexibility, martial arts forms, combat shifting, and magical development. There were specific exercises to build magical stamina (by casting and holding a wandless *Patronus* charm for longer and longer intervals), control (by wandlessly levitating more and more tennis balls while going through martial arts forms), power (the classic shooting gallery, with more and more durable targets), and finesse (more and more detailed *Image*-class illusion charms). Each day's workout ended with stretching and a meditation session. All told, she expected it to take anywhere from an hour to the entire day, depending on what point she was at in the training cycle and how much time she wanted to spend that day.

From yesterday's reading, she knew that, while she could use shifting to augment her physical abilities, only exercise would build the base level. The stronger she got *without* shifting, the more she'd be able to do *with.*

Popping back to the real world, she got on with it. Robbie joined her, and the two even sparred for a bit. This was complicated by the bond, as not only had the knowledge and instincts been shared, but so had the combo patterns. They found themselves throwing the same moves at the same time more often than not, and Elysia made a note for them both to work on that.

> - Check out The Kiln at Red Wharf Bay

Finally, after they were done training, Elysia shifted back to Harry-form and headed out into Durzkaban to borrow the phone. She'd had the idea that her friends might want to come along to check out the Red Wharf property. There wasn't enough time to send Hedwig with a letter asking Ron, nor did she have access to a floo. Hermione, on the other hand, lived in a muggle house, and had a telephone. And she'd given Elysia her number (and address) after the debacle with the bars and the flying car two summers ago.

Thankfully, Dudley was still at Smeltings until July, and Vernon was at work. Petunia was out in the garden, though it was nearing noon so she'd have to be quick before her aunt came back in out of the heat.

"Granger residence," Hermione's voice said.

"Hey, Hermione," Elysia said.

"Harry! Somehow I never expected you to call. You always send Hedwig, and I suppose I've just gotten so used to the way witches and wizards do things, it's always such an adjustment being back from Hogwarts over the summers."

"Breathe, Hermione," Elysia laughed. Hermione made a little *hmph* noise as she continued. "Anyway, you doing anything today? I stopped by Gringotts yesterday to see if anything of my parents' was in storage -- after last year, I got curious about the Marauders and all that -- and it turns out there was!"

"Ooh! Like what, Harry?" Hermione asked.

"Like a lot of things," Elysia replied. "Like years' worth of journals for both of them, and the deed to some place in Wales from my grandfather. There's a portkey at Gringotts, and I was planning on taking it down this afternoon to look around. Interested in coming with? You can meet Robbie, too."

"Robbie? Who's Robbie? Harry, it's been all of a day!" Hermione said.

"If you come with, you can find out," Elysia teased.

"Okay, fine," Hermione huffed. "What time?"

"Noon or so? We can grab lunch in Soho or something, make an afternoon of it."

"Harry, it's almost noon now! How're you going to get here so quickly?"

"You'll find out. See you in a bit, Hermione."

Ending the call, Elysia made it back to her room just as she heard Aunt Petunia coming in through the back door.



+++++



### Granger House, Crawley	1994/06/27	12:01

Robbie popped the two of them to Hermione's doorstep. Elysia wasn't sure how Robbie knew where it was -- she hadn't even seen him check a map. And yet here they were.

Robbie had shifted into his human form again, and Elysia was back in the androgynous look she'd left Gringotts in yesterday. They were both dressed in the same outfits as yesterday -- jeans, t-shirts, and the dragonhide boots and jackets (Robbie had laid claim on the Hebridean Black, while Elysia preferred the Ukrainian Ironbelly). Elysia wore a plain heather-grey v-neck, but Robbie's t-shirt said "Frankie Says Relax" in big letters across the chest.

The door burst open at Elysia's knock. "Harry!" Hermione flew at her, engulfing her in a classic Hermione-hug. It struck Elysia then just how off-kilter she always felt over the summer, because all of a sudden, *she didn't.*

Hermione disengaged the hug and held Elysia at arm's length. "Harry," she said, "what happened? You look *fantastic!* It's only been a day! How have you changed so much in only a day? And who is this?" She asked, turning to Robbie.

Elysia smiled. "Hullo, 'Mione. This is Robbie. My brother."

Hermione gasped. "Your what? Harry, I thought all your family was *dead!* Aside from those dreadful Dursleys, of course."

"It's a long story," Elysia said. "What say I fill you in over lunch? Robbie and I found this little sushi joint 'round the corner from the Leaky."



+++++



"So because you changed the words of the bond oath, you and Robbie have a twin bond now?" Hermione asked, nibbling on a piece of pickled ginger.

"Pretty much," Elysia said. She and Robbie had filled Hermione in over several rolls of sushi. It was a good thing Robbie had put a notice-me-not on their table after their food arrived, because Hermione simply could not contain herself. Her eyes got bigger and bigger as Elysia went on, and at several points she couldn't help but exclaim out loud.

"And you have memory-constructs of your parents in your mindscape?" She went on. 

Elysia nodded. 

"And a library in your head full of *more knowledge than Hogwarts!?*" Hermione exclaimed. 

Elysia nodded again.

"And on top of that you're set for life, money-wise," Hermione continued. "Are there any *other* Earth-shattering revelations you need to tell me?"

Elysia took a deep breath. "Just one more. Hermione, I'm a girl."

Hermione gasped. "What? Harry, what do you mean?"

"It's Elysia now, or Ellie for short, not Harry. At least, not when I don't have to be." She shifted into girl-form, letting her hair lengthen but keeping it her usual black. She swept her glasses off and leaned intently across the table towards Hermione. "You're the *only* person who knows so far, besides Robbie. I haven't even told Ron yet."

"Merlin," Hermione stammered, blushing. *Wow she's pretty,* she caught herself thinking.

Elysia shifted back, replacing her glasses. "Hermione? Please say something?" She said hesitantly.

"I... wow. Somehow, it makes sense," Hermione said. "So, are you, what's the word... transgender?"

Elysia shrugged. "I guess? Is that the word for not knowing you're a girl at first?"

"Pretty much," Hermione said. "I bet being able to shift like that helps a lot, huh?"

"Like you wouldn't believe."



+++++



After activating the portkey at Gringotts, the three of them appeared in an unpaved lane across from a fenced plot of land. A branch of the lane led into the property, with an arched gate proclaiming 'The Kiln.' In the distance, they could see a building of some sort.

Elysia immediately shifted back to girl-shape, and Robbie back to elf-shape. "Ah, much better," they both said, then looked at each other and burst out laughing. 

Hermione just gave them a look, though Elysia noticed her lips twitching.

They eventually made it to the end of the drive, to find that there were actually several buildings. One was a barn, painted a weathered red. Another was what looked like a distillery, with various faucets and fittings sticking from the walls. A third was a nondescript wooden building that nevertheless fairly shone when Elysia looked at it under mage-sight (which she'd learned from yesterday's primers).

The final building was a cozy-looking one-story farmhouse. It too shone under mage-sight, though not as brightly as the other building. In fact, that building reminded Elysia of something...

"Hey, you lot, I think that building's like the trunk," Elysia said to the others.

"Ooh!" Hermione squealed, and darted over to it.

The other two joined her as she tugged open the door. Inside, visible through the daylight streaming in behind them, was a runestone pedestal nearly identical to the one in Elysia's residential trunk.

Elysia cast a few wandless *lumos* orbs as Hermione dashed over to take a closer look. Robbie started examining the walls, and Elysia sent a few more orbs his way before joining Hermione.

"Thanks, Ellie," he murmured absently.

"Sure, bro," she replied, just as absently.

"Merlin's beard, you really weren't kidding about that bond," Hermione said.

"Huh?"

"Ellie, you just called Robbie 'bro.'"

"... I did? Huh. You OK with that, Robbie?" She called.

"Sure, Ellie. Hey, I think the runestone overloaded," He replied.

Elysia squinted at the pedestal. "You know, I think you're right. There're blast marks on the pedestal, and some rock dust."

Robbie nodded. "There's bits of rock all over the floor, too, and some of these traces are burned out. A *lot* of them, actually."

"I wonder what happened?" Hermione murmured.

"Dunno," Elysia shrugged. "One of Grandpa Fleamont's experiments, I suppose. Or Grandma Euphemia's, more likely."

"Ellie," Hermione said, stifling a giggle, "your grandfather's name is *Fleamont?*"



+++++



After that, the actual cottage was disconcertingly normal. The front door opened into a greatroom, with a kitchen area on one side, a dining area with a heavily-scuffed round six-seat table, a couple of beat-up leather sofas and a matching armchair, and a large, floo-size hearth. A hallway led to four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and the master suite. The whole place was very cozy, but also absolutely *covered* in decades' worth of dust. And aside from the table, sofas, and armchair, completely empty. No beds, no dressers or wardrobes, not even a desk. No personal effects. They made a quick circuit through the place and darted back outside, sneezing the whole way.

Robbie and Elysia looked at each other once the sneezes stopped. 

"Aerial survey?" 

"Uh-huh."

Elysia turned to Hermione. "Wanna come along?"

"What do you mean?" Hermione asked nervously. "You're not going to make me ride a broom, are you?"

Elysia winked at her and shifted into a hippogriff. 



+++++



Despite managing to keep from squeezing her eyes shut, Hermione maintained a death-grip on Elysia's neck despite the wandless sticking charm on her jeans as the girls and Robbie, also shifted to hippogriff, flew around the property.

Most of the land was sectioned off for crops, though the fields had obviously lain fallow for a long time. In the middle of the property, though, hidden behind the cottage, was a rusted and overgrown quidditch pitch and a ramshackle broom-shed.

"Ron would love this!" Hermione yelled over the rushing air.

Elysia could only chirp in agreement.

They landed in front of the pedestal building.

"Don't tell Ron you let me ride you," Hermione said, with a blushing smirk. "His head might explode."

Elysia flushed deep red, gaping. "I. Um. I think *my* head might explode."

Robbie laughed so hard he fell over.

## Chapter 5: Was This A Date?

The summer fell into a rhythm fairly quickly. Elysia had gotten into good enough shape that she'd been able to read the primers for more hard-style martial arts, like jiu jitsu, krav maga, and Shaolin animal-style kung fu. She'd moved on to 'Elysia's Combat Style: Stage 2,' which touched heavily on Jeet Kun Do. Mornings were spent training with Robbie, and afternoons were spent reading her family's journals, writing to friends, fiddling around with projects (such as adding night-vision runes to her glasses), finishing up summer homework, and frequently meeting up with Hermione. After coming out to her, Elysia no longer felt the need to shift into her 'Harry Potter' shape around Hermione, and they both got used to Elysia's girl-ness surprisingly quickly.

Hermione had expressed desire to learn some of what Elysia could now do (vocally and at great length), so Elysia began teaching her the basics of both mind magic and wandless casting. As part of these, she and Robbie also started teaching Hermione some tai chi.

They still made time to have fun, though. It was a good summer for cinema. Neither Elysia nor Robbie had ever been before, so Hermione taken them both to see *The Lion King,* *Baby's Day Out,* *Little Rascals,* *Forrest Gump,* and *The Mask.*

Robbie had wanted to examine the pedestal building at The Kiln again (and give the two friends some time without Elysia's 'brother' tagging along, he confided to her), so Elysia and Hermione saw *Black Beauty* just the two of them.

*Why does this feel like a date?* They both thought, walking out of the theater. Not that either of them had ever actually been on a date, but their hands had kept brushing while they were sharing a tub of popcorn, and neither girl was sure if it had been entirely accidental or not.

By now, Robbie and Elysia's bond had progressed to the point that they could, with effort, send messages to each other telepathically. So when Hermione asked if Elysia would stay for dinner, she let Robbie know and barely avoided blushing visibly at the smirk he sent back.

"Ugh, brothers," she grumbled good-naturedly to Hermione, as they walked through Crawley back to the Granger residence.

"What about Robbie now?" Hermione asked.

"Just teasing me a bit, is all," Elysia said. "It's amazing to see how much more self-assured he is compared to two years ago, or even the beginning of summer hols."

"You too, Ellie. Is that the bond's doing, do you think, or just different circumstances?"

"A bit of both, I suppose. Anyone'd do better away from the Malfoys or Durzkaban. But the bond probably has a pretty big effect. I know my work ethic's increased, too, probably as a side-effect. Did I tell you I wrote McGonagall? She's letting me drop Divination if I can test into Arithmancy. Which I can. I could test *out* of Arithmancy if I read far enough in my mindscape library, but if I do that for classes I'm actually taking, school will be *so boring.* As it is, I do have the math down, just not the applications."

"And also, this way we share a class just the two of us," Hermione smiled.

"That too, yeah." Elysia smiled back. They both blushed and looked away.

"*Ahem.* So, the bond," Hermione said quickly. "How exactly does that impact your and Robbie's personalities so much?"

"There's a few things that go into it, really. Do they go over the waveform model of magic in third-year Arithmancy?"

"The what?"

Elysia sighed. "Okay, this is going to be more complicated than I'd thought. Let's see, analogies... D'you know how light and radio and magnetism and all that can be thought of as waves? Well, magic is like that too."

Hermione looked startled, then got a thoughtful expression on her face. "Go on."

"The other thing you need to know is that magic comes from the soul, more-or-less. Power comes from internal harmony of intent. The stronger, more unified, more *in sync,* I guess, your intent is, the more powerful the magic is as a direct result."

"More focused, maybe?" Hermione queried. "Like a laser?"

"Exactly!" Elysia exclaimed. "Past a certain threshold, it starts to self-reinforce. A bond is similar. And since the parameters of the bond are defined by the oath, it tends to reinforce things related to the oath. The Waveform model makes a whole lot of things about magic make more sense, really, even if it *is* just an abstraction and not totally accurate. ...What?" She asked, warily, as Hermione was staring at her with a funny look on her face.

"I like this new you," Hermione said. "I always knew you were smart, but it's *wonderful* to be able to have conversations like this with you. Before this summer, most of our conversations were taken up with homework, quidditch, or whatever crisis of the moment. Now... you just seem more comfortable in your own skin. More confident, more driven. More playful, too. Happier. I don't know, maybe that's just growing up. But I don't think it's *only* that."

Elysia was silent for a little while, thinking. She hadn't thought about it much after the first couple of days, but she really had changed a *lot* over the summer. Her birthday had been a couple of weeks ago, her first as Elysia, and all of the cards and such were addressed to 'Harry.' Her Hogwarts letter, which had also arrived that day, was the same. It was jarring to think that that name still referred to her, and by necessity would continue to until she could change it upon reaching her majority.

She still hadn't told Ron about most of it, either. Not that she was a girl, nor that she was a shifter, nor the past-life knowledge. She'd mentioned Robbie, and some of the things from the vault (though not the money or the trunk), but not The Kiln or all the time she was spending with Hermione. And none of that had occurred to her *at all* until just now. It struck her all at once that she was growing apart from her first friend, and she *really* didn't know how to feel about that.

"Merlin and Morgana, I really *have* changed," she breathed. "Hermione, I've not told Ron about hardly *any* of this!"

"I can just see his eyes glazing over if you did, though," Hermione replied.

"No, I mean hardly *anything* about this summer. I haven't even told him I'm a girl!"

Hermione stopped dead in her tracks.

"Or the past-life knowledge, or the shifting, or even the trunk!" Elysia continued, before noticing that Hermione wasn't beside her anymore. "Um, Hermione?"

"Oh no, I forgot you're famous! And I know how much you hate all of that, but Ellie, you *know* people are going to make a fuss about anything you do. And how do magicals even think about trans people, anyway? Is it even an issue? So much else is pre-Victorian, so maybe not, but..."

Elysia couldn't help but smile. "Breathe, Hermione. I got through that Heir of Slytherin hogwash, didn't I?"

Hermione took a deep breath, and smiled sheepishly. "You're right, it's not quite life-or-death, is it?"

"I don't suppose so," Elysia said. "Still, it's something I should have at least given *some* thought before now. I guess I just felt that if *you* were okay with it all, the rest didn't really matter."

Hermione blushed. "I'm flattered."

"Still, that's not really fair to Ron, is it?" Elysia continued.

"Well, maybe not, but he *is* a bloke," Hermione said. "And Ron can be a particularly *insensitive* bloke sometimes."

"That's true. By the way, I'm sorry for being such a git over that Firebolt last Christmas. You were only looking out for me, like you always do. You deserve better than my throwing a tantrum over it. And anyway, you were right," she grinned, "it *was* sent by Sirius."

"Of course I was right. I'm *always* right," Hermione said with mock solemnity.

"We'll have to make that the Hogwarts Mantra," Elysia said. "'Hermione is always right. I will listen to Hermione. I will not ignore Hermione's recommendations. Hermione is God. If this ever happens again, Hermione will personally rip your lungs out.'"

Hermione stuck her tongue out, then giggled. "I didn't know you'd seen Babylon 5!"

"I haven't, not really. Just heard a bit here and there when Dudley had the telly up too loud."

"Maybe it'll be out on tape someday and we can watch it together, then. I wonder..."

"Are you thinking about how to get a VHS and a telly to work inside Hogwarts too?"

Hermione smirked. "Maybe..."

By this time, they'd made it back to the Granger residence. They were just about to enter when Hermione suddenly spun around and hugged Elysia tightly.

"Um, 'Mione?" Elysia asked as the other witch let go. "What was that for?"

"Do I need a reason to hug my best friend?" She replied. "Besides, are you really objecting?"

"Never," Elysia stated firmly. "You couldn't *Imperio* me to object to one of your hugs."

Smiling brightly, Hermione led the way inside.



### Granger House, Crawley	1994/08/20	17:36

Elysia was nervous. Since they both worked, she'd only met Hermione's parents a couple of times before, and never had a chance for much in the way of conversation with them. And now she was staring down the barrel of not only an entire meal's worth of such, but also coming out to them.

*Breathe,* she told herself. *Hermione's right here. She's got your back. She always does.*

Hermione's parents were just finishing up in the kitchen. "Hey, kids," her mom called. "You're just in time."

They all sat around the dinner table as Mr. Granger brought in the main course, a pot roast.

"So," he said as he took his seat. "You're the mysterious Elysia we've been hearing so much about this summer."

"It's so lovely to see Hermione having a friend to do things with in the summer," Mrs. Granger gushed. "How did you two meet, anyway?"

"Um, we met on the train to Hogwarts back in first year, Mrs. Granger," Elysia said hesitantly.

"Oh? Odd that she's never mentioned you before now," Mrs. Granger said.

"Only ever those two boys, Ron and Harry," Mr. Granger said. "Mostly Harry, really," he added with a smirk at his daughter.

Elysia gave Hermione a look, one eyebrow raised high. Hermione blushed and busied herself with her food, refusing to meet Elysia's eyes.

"Why Hermione, I didn't know you cared," she teased. Turning back to Mr. & Mrs. Granger, she said, "As it happens, she *has* mentioned me. I'm Harry. Or, I was, I suppose. I'm transgender. Didn't click that I was a girl 'til after all the fuss up at school was over for the year, but then once I twigged to it, things moved pretty fast."

The Granger parents seemed shocked, but not, Elysia hoped, in a bad way.

"It turns out I have latent shape-shifting abilities," she continued. "Found my parents' journals, put a few things together, and, well..." She shifted into Harry-shape and waved shyly at them before shifting back.

"My goodness!" Mrs. Granger gasped. 

"Well. This is a lot to take in," Mr. Granger said. "But I thought you kids weren't allowed to use magic outside of school?"

"We're not allowed to use *wands* outside of school, Mr. Granger, aside from in an emergency," Elysia replied. "There are plenty of other ways to use magic -- such as runes, potions, wandless casting, and innate abilities like my shifting."

"How fascinating! Could you possibly show us some of that? We've never had a chance to see what Hermione's been learning up at that school because of that law," Mrs. Granger said.

Elysia was nonplussed. "You're really okay with me being a girl? Just like that?"

"You *do* seem much happier, dear, and that's the important thing," Mrs. Granger replied. 

Elysia smiled in relief. Hermione patted her arm, and said, "Well, after we eat, how about we show you what Ellie's been teaching me this summer?"



+++++



After dinner, they all moved into the living room, where Hermione showed off some wandless magic, Elysia turned into various animals, and the two of them demonstrated a magically-augmented round of a tai chi exercise called Push Hands. Just as they finished, Hedwig and a tiny little ball of energy that may or may not have been an owl flew in with letters from Ron for the two girls.

> Harry,
>
> Dad's managed to get tickets to the Quidditch World Cup final, and Top Box at that! Someone at work owed him a favor, so we're all going ('cept Mum), and there's tickets for you and Hermione too. He even made sure there was room for Robbie, though since he's a house-elf he won't need a ticket.
>
> Anyway, the match is the day after tomorrow, and Mum says you and Hermione can stay with us for the rest of Break. 
>
> Dad said he can pick you up from the Dursleys, but it might be easier if Robbie could bring you. You know how Dad gets.
>
> See you soon!
>
> ​    - Ron

Elysia and Hermione looked at each other.

"You're not going to subject Mr. Weasley and the Dursleys to each other, are you, Ellie?" Hermione asked.

"Merlin, no! Mr. Weasley's a sweet man, but he's a bit... *something* when it comes to Muggle things," Elysia responded. "Uncle Vernon would have a stroke. Robbie?"

Robbie popped into the Grangers' living room. "You rang, Ellie?"

"Hey, bro. Robbie, these are Hermione's parents." Elysia said, making introductions. "Anyway, Ron's invited us -- you, me, and Hermione -- to stay for the rest of summer, and to join them at the Quidditch World Cup final. Top Box, even. Mr. Weasley offered to pick us up, but..."

Robbie snorted. "But the Dursleys. No worries, I'll just pop us over and save everyone the trouble. Noon-ish?"

"Works for me. Hermione? Mr. & Mrs. Granger?"

Hermione turned honest-to-Morgana *puppy eyes* on her parents. "Please, Mum and Dad?"

Hermione's parents looked at each other and laughed. "Goodness, Hermione, I thought you didn't like quidditch if Har - er, Elysia wasn't playing," Mrs. Granger teased.

Hermione blushed. "But, Mum, it's an international event! Think of the cultural experience!"

Elysia and Mr. Granger shared a grin. "Never change, Hermione," Elysia said fondly.



+++++



That night, Elysia popped into her mindscape to speak with the memory-constructs of her parents. At the same time, Hermione sought out her own parents.

"Mum, Dad, can I talk to you?"

"Of course, sweetie, what is it?"

"... I think I'm starting to fall for my best friend."



## Chapter 6: To The Burrow

### #4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey	1994/08/21	11:55

The next morning, Elysia wrote to her godfather, Sirius Black. While they'd exchanged a couple of letters over the summer, she'd told him even less than she had Ron thus far. She thought about it, sure, but so much had happened that she didn't even know where to start. She finally wrote about the Quidditch World Cup and that she and Hermione could be reached care of the Weasleys for the rest of the summer, and sent Hedwig on her way.

That done, she decided to pop into Elysium and check in with Janet. As she appeared in the study, Janet walked in from the hallway. "Oh good, you're here. There are some important things you need to know before you return to the magical world."

Elysia got comfortable in one of the chairs as Janet assumed her lecturing stance. "First, Albus Dumbledore is not your friend. He's manipulated you since before you were even born."

Elysia gasped, whether in shock our outrage she wasn't sure.

"There was a prophecy made about you and Voldemort," Janet continued, "and he's taken it to mean that you need to sacrifice yourself in order for Voldemort to finally be defeated for good. So he manipulated events to, first, bring the child of the prophecy to light -- it could have been either you or Neville Longbottom -- and then, once it was clear (to him, anyway) that the prophecy referred to you, he had you raised in such a way that you'd be willing to sacrifice yourself to defeat Voldemort without a second thought. He's desperate, not necessarily malicious, but the road to Hell is paved with good intentions, after all."

"But... *why?* Why does he think that I have to die?"

"Because of the piece of Voldemort's soul that was in your scar, that anchors him to this world. He can't die while they still exist. He's made several, through the darkest of magic, but the one in your scar was unintentional and he never even knew about it. We'll get back to the others, but the one on your scar was removed before you were sent back."

"But Dumbledore doesn't know that, right?"

"Exactly, so he'll still try and manipulate you to his own ends. In your last life, he even resorted to potions after this year to prevent any attachments strong enough to give you the desire to live instead of sacrificing yourself. You've changed enough already that he might do that sooner, so you need to know how to counteract them. And teach Hermione too; she's close enough to you that she's a target for him as well. And one other, but you haven't met her yet."

"Not Ron?" Elysia asked.

"No, not Ron," Janet confirmed. "The entire Weasley family has unquestioning faith in Dumbledore. Even if they knew about his meddling, they'd think it for the best, and go along with it without a second thought."

"So, what, should I just walk away from the whole family because they're too trusting? From my first friend?"

"No, of course not," Janet said. "Just don't expect them to pick you over the Headmaster if it comes to that. He's infallible to them, despite all evidence to the contrary. People believe what they want to believe, and magicals are even more prone to this sort of thinking. Culturally speaking."

"I should probably act like as little has changed as possible, then," Elysia mused. "Show too much independence and it sounds like he'll start getting heavy-handed."

"Most likely," Janet confirmed. "He *is* the one who went against your parents' wills and had you placed with the Dursleys. Left you on the doorstep in a basket, in *November,* no less. And he sealed the wills so nobody would find out. Also, he's the one who cast the *Fidelius* charm to hide your parents. He *knew* Sirius was innocent."

"What!?" Elysia shrieked.

"He'd claim Sirius' incarceration was a 'necessary evil' to keep you safely hidden under impenetrable blood-wards tied to your mother's sacrifice. He's not a malicious man, Elysia. He has good intentions. But as the saying goes, the road to Hell is paved with those, and Dumbledore is rather far down his own personal highway."

"Lovely. So what's this about soul pieces, then?" Elysia asked, changing the subject. She was feeling horribly betrayed, and didn't want to deal with it yet.

"They're called horcruxes," Janet said. "Voldemort made six intentionally. You already destroyed one, the diary in your second year."

"Merlin! And there are *five more* of those things lying around?" Elysia exclaimed. "Glad I got to enjoy this summer, because it sounds like it was the last carefree one I'm going to get for awhile."

"That's why you insisted we give you this one," Janet agreed. "Anyway, The List has an appendix on the details of the horcruxes. You won't be able to do much about most of them yet, but The List will update when you can."

Elysia threw herself backwards into the chair. "No pressure, then," she said morosely.

"Oh, and one more thing," Janet added. "There's going to be a bit of a Death Eater reunion the night of the match. Someone will cast the Dark Mark which will cause them all to apparate away. Plan accordingly."

+++++



There being nothing to pack, what with all her and Robbie's worldly possessions fitting handily in the magically-expanded residential trunk, the two spent the morning in their usual training routine. When noon rolled around, Elysia shifted into her androgynous Harry-shape and, after shrinking the trunk and pocketing it, headed downstairs to inform her relatives that she would be leaving for the rest of the summer. She found them at the table, just starting in on lunch.

"Where'd you get those clothes!?" Dudley accused.

"Stole them, no doubt," Vernon said.

"Birthday present from my godfather," Elysia lied smoothly. "You know, Sirius Black? The escaped mass-murdering convict?"

The Dursleys paled. "Er, right," Vernon choked out.

"Anyway, just wanted to let you know. I'm leaving to stay with some school friends for the rest of the summer, and I'll get to the school from there on my own."

"What makes you think you're in any position to just come in here and *tell* us what you're doing, *boy?*" Vernon growled.

"I learned something interesting this summer," Elysia said, grinning evilly. "You know how I'm not allowed to use a wand outside of school?"

Vernon nodded cautiously.

Elysia snapped her fingers, conjuring a ball of Hermione's favorite bluebell flame in the palm of her hand. "I don't need a wand to do magic. Between that and Sirius, I rather think *you're* the ones who need to re-think their positions, don't you?"

Petunia gasped. Vernon nodded quickly, his many chins jiggling grotesquely. Dudley simply bolted up the stairs.

"Go on, then," Vernon snapped. 

Before he could say anything further, Elysia disapparated.



### Granger House, Crawley	1994/08/21	11:59

Elysia and Robbie appeared on the Grangers' doorstep with twin *pops* of displaced air. As Elysia was just about to knock, the door flew open and, with a cry of "Ellie!" suddenly her arms were full of her favorite bushy-haired brunette.

"Hey, 'Mione," Elysia said, squeezing her back. "Ready to go?"

She nodded, finally letting Elysia go before leading the way inside. "Thank you for teaching me that wandless shrinking charm, Ellie! I managed to fit so many more books in my trunk!"

Elysia giggled. "Of course you did. Hullo, Mr. & Mrs. Granger!"

"Hello, Ellie," Mrs. Granger replied.

"Long time no see," Mr. Granger grinned.

"Ellie, I've just thought of something," Hermione said. "You're not out to the Weasleys yet. Should Robbie and I call you 'Harry' again until that changes?"

Elysia thought for a bit. "Yeah, probably, at least when it's not just us. Not sure I want to let on how much I've changed yet; you know how Ron can get. And anyway, we still don't know how the magical world takes transgender people in general, much less their beloved *Boy-Who-Lived.*" She sneered the last part.

Hermione patted her arm comfortingly. "Well, whatever happens, we'll get through it together."



### The Burrow, Ottery St. Catch-Pole	1994/08/21	12:05

After saying their goodbyes to Hermione's parents, Robbie popped the three of them to the lane outside the Burrow's front gate. Elysia was still in Harry-shape, and Robbie was still in human-shape as they'd come from a muggle area. Over their bond, the two giggled at how the Weasleys might react to Robbie's appearance as they walked toward the Burrow's front door. Hermione set Crookshanks down, and, spotting a gnome, he darted off to chase it.

Arthur Weasley opened the door as they approached. "Hello, Harry, Hermione, a- Oh my. Molly?" He called back into the house. "Does Ron have a twin I didn't know about?" He winked at them. "Come in, you lot. Molly's just finished making lunch."

The Burrow was more crowded than usual. It turned out that, when Ron had said that "we're all going ('cept Mum)," he'd meant *all* of the Weasleys (aside from Molly). Ron, Ginny, and the Twins were in the living room chatting with the two oldest Weasley boys, Bill and Charlie.

Ron looked caught sight of them and stopped mid-word, looking back and forth between Elysia and Robbie, and gaping like a particularly large-mouthed fish. "Harry? Bloody hell, mate!"

Ginny looked up, caught sight of Elysia, and blushed bright red.

"Language, Ronald!" Hermione snapped, but she was smirking as she did.

"See, Hermione? I told you it'd be funny," Robbie said.

"Hullo, Weasleys!" Elysia said. "This is Robbie."

Robbie finally shifted back to elf-shape and bowed elaborately, giggling all the while. The twins applauded.

"Quite the entrance, wouldn't you say, Forge?"

"Yes, indeed, Gred."

"Anyway, honorary Weasleys, meet the oldest of the bunch --"

"Bill --"

"And Charlie."

The twins gestured to the oldest two in the room. Charlie was built like the twins: stocky and strong, with callouses visible across the room and a shiny burn on one arm. He had a broad, good-natured face which was covered in freckles. 

Bill was a surprise. Elysia'd expected an older version of Percy from what Ron had said about him in the past: Head Boy, worked for Gringotts. She'd imagined someone fussy, bossy, and self-important. The reality, though, was that while he was tall and lanky like Percy (and Ron, for that matter) he could easily have been Percy's evil twin. He had long hair pulled back in a ponytail, dragonhide boots, and an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it. All in all, the impression was more rock-star than anything else.

"Nice boots," he said.

Charlie leaned forward excitedly. "Ooh, are those Ukrainian Ironbelly? Ooh, and Hebridean Black?" He added, catching sight of Robbie's ensemble. "Where did you find these?"

"My family's storage vault," Elysia answered. "I got curious after everything last year, so first day back Robbie and I went to Gringotts to see if there was anything interesting. Found a bunch of clothes, my parents' and grandparents' journals, and a few other odds and ends. It's nice to have clothes that actually fit."

Ron had made his way over finally, having replaced his jaw. "Well, you look great, mate," he said, clapping Elysia on the back.

"Lunch is ready, everyone! Please help carry it all out!" Mrs. Weasley called, appearing from the Kitchen. "Oh, hello, dears. We're eating out in the garden; there's too many to fit comfortably inside."

Robbie darted over. "I'll bring everything out for you, Mrs. Weasley."

"Thank you... Robbie, I presume?" Mrs. Weasley said. "Harry, Hermione, why don't you take your things up? Harry, you're in Ron's room, and Hermione, you're with Ginny. And bring Percy down with you when you're done, please." She turned back to the kitchen. "Merlin knows that boy works so hard; he needs his energy."



+++++



Elysia, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny trooped up the stairs. Ginny and Hermione split off at the first door up the stairs, which was Ginny's room, while the other two continued to the top of the stairs, where Ron's room was.

Elysia hadn't been here since the summer before last, when Ron and the twins had broken her out of Durzkaban after Robbie had ruined one of Vernon's business dinners. It was still awash in Chudley Cannons Orange. Scabbers' -- Wormtail's, rather -- old cage was gone; in its place was a cage containing the ball of owl-shaped energy which had delivered Hermione's invitation last night. The owl was bouncing around the cage and twittering excitedly.

"It's a bit tight in here, sorry," Ron said, squeezing his way in. Somehow there'd been four beds stuffed inside the room. "Fred and George are in here too, because Bill and Charlie have their room," he explained. "Percy gets to keep his all to himself, though, because *he* has to *work.* Git. He *has* an office, you know!"

Elysia just rolled her eyes, pulled out her trunk, un-shrunk it, and shoved it under the bed next to Ron's.



+++++



Lunch was a raucous affair. 

It started with Bill and Charlie making the tables duel out on the lawn, causing Percy to stick his head out the window and yell at them to stop making so much noise. Then, with a squeak, Mrs. Weasley's wand turned into a giant rubber mouse, causing her to yell at the twins about something called 'Weasley's Wizard Wheezes.' 

Eventually, everyone had taken their seats. Elysia had Hermione on her right and Robbie on her left, with Bill, Ron, and Ginny across from them. The conversation wandered all over, from Charlie's work with dragons in Romania to Bill's curse-breaking adventures for Gringotts in Egypt, to some of the adventures Elysia, Hermione, and Ron had had at Hogwarts. 

"Wait, the basilisk was *how big?*" Charlie exclaimed.

"'Bout five feet wide, maybe sixty long?" Elysia replied. "Didn't exactly stop to check, you see, on account of the *fangs the size of my arm.*"

"Bloody hell," Charlie breathed.

"Can we change the subject?" Hermione asked, nodding at Ginny, who had gone pale and shaky.

"Please," Elysia said.

"Alright, then," Charlie agreed. "Sorry, Gin. Harry, heard you're Gryffindor's new seeker."

"Youngest in a century," Ron bragged. "He's never failed to catch the snitch, either. Well," he amended, "except for that one time when the dementors swarmed him."

"Not *helping,* Ron," Elysia said through gritted teeth.

"Anyway," Charlie continued, "I was a pretty fair seeker myself, in my day. Care for a seeker's duel?"

Elysia smirked. "You're on!"



+++++



When lunch was over, and the aftermath cleared away, everyone trooped down to the clearing in the orchard which was used as a makeshift quidditch pitch by the Weasley kids.

Charlie, riding a Cleansweep 7, pulled out a snitch and grinned. "Gotta keep in practice, eh, Potter?"

Elysia pulled out her shrunken Firebolt. Leaping astride even as it unshrank, she grinned devilishly. "You talk too much, Weasley," she snarked.

Charlie's eyes bugged out, and he gulped. "A *Firebolt?* You have a *Firebolt!?*" He squeaked.

Ron cackled.

It was a short duel.



+++++



They all went to bed early that night. Mrs. Weasley had offered to pick up Elysia and Hermione's school things, but Elysia was using her mother's old textbooks and Hermione had gone with her parents as soon as the letters had arrived.

"Even the dress robes?" Mrs. Weasley asked Elysia.

"Yes, Mrs. Weasley," Elysia said. "I found some in my parents' storage vault that suit very nicely."

"Well, if you're sure, dear," she said. "Now, get to bed. You'll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup."



+++++



"Harry seems different," Ginny said to Hermione as they lay awake that night.

"Oh?" Hermione replied. "How so?"

Ginny tossed and turned for a bit, then rolled over to face Hermione. "Lots of ways. He seems more self-assured, but also less... edgy, I guess? Kind of girly, actually. Not that he's ever been all that buff or anything, just..." She shrugged. "It's weird. I thought boys were supposed to get handsome as they got older. Him? First word that comes to mind to describe him is 'pretty.' It's confusing, if I'm honest."

"Still crushing on the Boy-Who-Lived, Gin?"

"And the boy who saved my life two years ago," Ginny retorted. "You should've seen him, Hermione, with that sword in his hands and that giant snake dead behind him. It was like something out of one of those *Harry Potter* storybooks, only better!"

"I *have* seen him, remember? He saved me from that troll in first year, and he even ran off over a hundred dementors with a single *Patronus* just a few months ago." Hermione sighed. "You know Harry doesn't think he's anything special. He *hates* how famous he is, and how much of a fuss everyone makes over the Boy-Who-Lived stuff. Even if he *is* a hero in his own right."

"D'you think... maybe he's started to accept that finally, and that's why he's changing?"

Hermione snorted. "That or puberty. Honestly, my money's on the latter."

Ginny sighed.

"You really need to let that crush go, Ginny. Has he shown any sign at all that it's requited?"

"No, I don't suppose he has," Ginny said sadly. "He treats me like I'm his little sister. As if I need yet another big brother!"

"He's always wanted siblings. And anyway you could do worse for a brother than Harry."

Ginny scoffed. "I have! You've met Percy! Git has barely said two words to any of us that wasn't yelling at us to be quiet since he started at the Ministry."

"Still," She continued after a moment, "if Harry *does* turn out a girl, I don't suppose it would change my chances one way or another. Naught times naught is still nothing; pretty sure even *Charlie* has a better shot than me at this point. But it *does* have me thinking. *Do* I like girls? I suppose even thinking about it means I probably do, at least a little bit."

Hermione hummed noncommittally.

"What about you, Hermione?" Ginny continued.

"What *about* me?" Hermione retorted.

"Do *you* like girls?"

"Why Miss Weasley, are you coming on to me?" Hermione teased.

Ginny blushed. "No! You're like my sister. Answer the question."

Hermione thought for a while. "Well... I don't know. I've certainly never found any *wizards* all that attractive."

"Oh really?" Ginny said. "What about Lockhart? I recall you being quite starry-eyed at Flourish & Blotts that year."

"That ponce?" Hermione scoffed. "He wrote the books. I always get a little bit star-struck when I get to meet an author. There was certainly no *attraction* there." She shuddered.

"Alright, alright," Ginny said. "Then what about girls?"

"What about them?"

"Hermione, you know what I mean! Stop trying to wriggle out of it!" Ginny stuck her tongue out.

Hermione stuck hers out right back, surprising the younger girl.

"You've changed too, Hermione," Ginny said softly.

"In a good way, I hope?" Hermione asked, hesitantly.

"Yeah." Ginny said, smiling softly. "Even if you *are* still a swot."

Hermione huffed. "Oh, *I'm* a swot? D'you know what Harry wants to do after Hogwarts?"

"Play quidditch for England?" Ginny asked.

Hermione snorted. "Enchanting. He wants to be an enchanter. Or 'artificer,' as he calls it. Apparently the two are different somehow."

"But don't you need Runes and Arithmancy for that?" Ginny asked, surprise colouring her tone.

"He got McGonagall to let him drop Divination and test into them instead."

"Wow, wonder what brought *that* on," Ginny mused.

"His grandmother's journals, probably," Hermione answered. "She was apparently quite good at it. Had some novel ideas about modular rune schemes."

"Okay, so you're a swot and he's a boffin," Ginny hummed. "You're still dodging the question, you prat! Do you or do you not play for the Harpies?"

Hermione laughed in shock at Ginny's euphemism, then huffed. "Fine. Sure. 'Sweet mother, I cannot weave -- slender Aphrodite has overcome me with longing for a girl.' Is that a problem?"

"Why would it be?" Ginny asked, confused.

"It's controversial in the muggle world," Hermione said. "I wasn't sure how the magical world felt about sexuality and gender identity and all that."

"Nobody cares, as long as the bloodlines are continued," Ginny responded, "and there's rituals and such for any families that can't or won't have a child the usual way."

"Huh," Hermione said.



## Chapter 7: The Quidditch World Cup

Morning came too soon even Elysia, who was already in the habit of rising early. The sky was still dark when Mrs. Weasley shook everyone awake.

"It's time, dears," she said. "You've got a bit of a hike ahead of you."

Eventually all of the kids in the house were roused, readied, and rounded up.

"Why aren't Bill, Charlie, and Percy awake yet?" Ron asked petulantly.

"Well, they're of-age, aren't they?" Mrs. Weasley answered. "They're apparating later. You lot need to catch the portkey."

Ron grumbled incoherently under his breath.

Mrs. Weasley gave them each a hug and a bundle of egg sandwiches as she chivvied them out the door.

After hiking through the cold darkness of the pre-dawn morning, up a dew-slippery hillside for nearly an hour, they finally reached the top of Stoatshead Hill, where they encountered the Diggories. Amos, the father, had a bad habit of bragging about his son to the detriment of everyone else, especially Elysia. Cedric, the son, for his part was thoroughly embarrassed about it, but Hermione locked eyes with Elysia and, over passive legilimency, sent: *doesn't he just have the most* punchable *face?*

Eventually, everyone managed to arrange themselves so they could all reach the portkey, which turned out to be a mangy old boot. Elysia and Hermione bent their knees and, alone of the group, managed to stay standing when they arrived at their destination.

"Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill," a voice said.

Mr. Weasley chatted with the two wizards who seemed to be coordinating portkey arrivals, getting directions to their campsite. After checking in with the muggle in charge of the site, who kept needing to be *obliviated* (according to one of the Ministry workers, anyway), they finally reached the field where all of the tents were.

Elysia could see why the muggles kept catching on. Most of the tents looked as if they'd at least *started* as normal, non-magical tents, but here and there someone had slipped up and added something absurd, such as a chimney or a weather-vane. And there were a few which were so outré they could only be magical. There was one which looked straight from *Arabian Nights,* with striped silk awnings and several live peacocks tethered by the door. Another resembled nothing so much as a miniature castle, with three floors and honest-to-Merlin *turrets.* 

Eventually, they reached a plot next to a wood, with a sign planted in it saying WEEZLY.

"Best spot in the place," Mr. Weasley said happily. "Now, strictly speaking, we shouldn't use magic while we're out on muggle land in these numbers. We'll have to put the tents up by hand!"

"Oh," Robbie said. "Oops?"

They all turned to find that Robbie had already set up the two tents they'd brought. Mr. Weasley looked a bit disappointed, but the relief on his children's faces was plain.

"Um, Mr. Weasley?" Hermione asked. "How're we going to fit so many people into only two tents?"

"Why don't you take a look inside?" Mr. Weasley said with a wink.

Elysia and Hermione entered one of the tents to find what appeared to be a three-bedroom flat, complete with kitchenette and bathroom.

"It's like my trunk, then," Elysia murmured to Hermione quietly.

"One day you're going to have to give me the tour," Hermione replied.

Mr. Weasley roped Elysia, Hermione, and Ron into going to collect water for tea, largely as an excuse for them to explore.

They ran across several classmates: fellow Gryffindor Seamus Finnegan, whose tent was covered in Shamrocks, sitting with his mum and his best friend, Dean Thomas; Oliver Wood, Gryffindor's former quidditch captain, who had just signed to Puddlemere United; Ernie Macmillan, who was a Hufflepuff in their year; and Cho Chang, a pretty girl who was the seeker for Ravenclaw's quidditch team. She waved to Elysia, who winked back flirtingly, causing her to blush and Hermione to giggle.

"Bloody hell, mate, you're a dangerous one," Ron quipped. "Where'd *that* come from?"

Hermione smirked.

"It's easier when it doesn't matter, I guess," Elysia said.

"Doesn't *matter?*" Ron retorted, incredulously. "What, are you into blokes or something? That's *Cho Chang!* She's the prettiest girl in school!"

"To you, maybe," Elysia said. "And no, I'm definitely not into blokes. She's just not my type, I guess." She shrugged. "Besides, isn't she with Diggory?"

"Yeah, so? She's still gorgeous!" Ron said.

"Methinks the Weasley doth protest too much," Hermione snarked.

"I think you're right," Elysia smirked. "You sure you're not into blokes, Ron? Viktor Krum, maybe?"

Ron scowled.

"Maybe just Harry," Hermione laughed.

Elysia winked at Ron, grinning, and waggled her eyebrows. 

Ron flushed. "Prat!" He said, stomping off ahead of them.

Elysia rolled her eyes. "Boy takes himself way too seriously for someone related to Fred & George."

"Percy," Hermione retorted. "And to be fair," Hermione continued, blushing, "you *are* much too good at that look."

"It's not so hard," Elysia scoffed. "You try."

"I don't think that's really my style," Hermione replied.

Elysia looked at her for a moment. "Fair enough. You're more the 'doe-eyed innocence with a hidden wicked streak' type, I think."

Hermione assumed a 'who, me?' face, but it failed miserably as her lip kept twitching. They both burst out laughing.



+++++



They returned to find Mr. Weasley playing with matches, and the twins 'supervising.' Hermione took over, and eventually they had a fire going. Mr. Weasley kept up a running commentary on all the Ministry workers passing by as they waited for the fire to die down to cooking coals.

Bill, Charlie, and Percy walked up from the apparition point in the woods just as the coals were ready. They all sat around the fire cooking sausages on sticks (the sandwiches Mrs. Weasley'd sent them with having been devoured long since).

Ludo Bagman, the head of the Department of Games and Sports at the Ministry, dropped by and tried to get them to bet on the match. Mr. Weasley bet a galleon on Ireland to win. Fred and George almost bet their life savings on Ireland to win but Krum catching the snitch, but Elysia took them aside and mentioned that she'd heard rumors that Bagman liked to pay out his books with leprechaun gold, and the goblins weren't too happy about that. So they bet 20 galleons and a fake wand instead, and Elysia promised, if their business plan was good enough, when she reached her majority she'd invest enough in Weasley's Wizard Wheezes for them to set up shop.

Then Bartemius Crouch, Percy's boss and the head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation, apparated in and dragged Bagman away, berating him over the Bulgarian delegation requesting twelve more seats in the Top Box. Bagman went, dropping hints about some big mystery event at Hogwarts this year.

Elysia decided she'd better pop into her mindscape and see if there were any more language books, and leaned back in her seat with closed eyes.

> To Do
>
> - ~~Find and read the primers on French, Bulgarian, Irish Gaelic, Scots Gaelic, Welsh, Russian, Greek, Spanish, Swiss, and German~~

As the afternoon wore on, the lanes between the tents began to fill with salesmen, with souvenirs of all sorts. Ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat; an animated figurine of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian seeker; and a large green luminous rosette.

Elysia's attention was drawn to a cart full of brass binoculars covered in dials and knobs. The saleswizard called them 'omnioculars,' and explained all about the functions. Elysia decided to buy a set for everyone in their party. Ron tried to argue, but she insisted. "Consider it my way of paying your family back for getting me a seat in the Top Box."

They got back to their campsite, where Elysia handed around the omnioculars. They'd just gotten everything squared away when a gong boomed out through the campsite, and green and red lanterns lit a path through the woods.

"It's time!" Mr. Weasley exclaimed, leading them excitedly down the path.



### World Cup Stadium	1994/08/22	20:00

On the other side of the wood stood a *massive* stadium which seemed to be made of gold. They climbed all the way up to the Top Box, which was situated exactly halfway between the goalposts on either end of the pitch. The box had an open area in the back, where they all entered, and two rows of ten seats each up front, overlooking the pitch.

They were almost the first to arrive, so they all filed into the front row. Robbie conjured a seat on the left end, with Hermione next, then Elysia, then Ron next to her. In the second row, behind Hermione, sat the only other occupant of the box -- another house elf, who was trying valiantly to ignore the exceedingly high view over the railing.

"Winky?" Robbie said, surprised.

"Dobby?" The other elf said. "But -- you is wearing clothes!"

"It's Robbie now," Robbie replied. "I'm a Potter elf." For Robbie was wearing the uniform he'd found in the storage vault, with the Potter crest displayed proudly upon the left breast. He was still wearing his dragonskin boots and jacket, though. "And Harry's brother," he added proudly.

Winky gasped. "Is this true, sir?" She asked, turning to Elysia. "Is Harry Potter taking in a trouble-maker like this one and giving him ideas above his station?"

"Robbie is family," Elysia said firmly. "We take care of each other. I don't think Robbie's a trouble-maker at all, or at least no more than I am."

Hermione snorted softly at that.

"And I'm sure I don't know what you mean by 'ideas above his station,'" Elysia continued. "Magic says he's my brother, and he behaves as a brother should."

"Brother!" Winky squeaked. "Begging yous pardon, but Harry Potter bes just as odd as Robbie."

"Why thank you," Elysia grinned.

Winky shuddered and went back to hiding from the heights.



+++++



The box slowly filled over the next half hour. Mr. Weasley and Percy kept shaking hands with VIPs as they entered. Minister Fudge came in with the Bulgarian Minister, who seemed to not speak a word of English.

"Ah, Harry, my boy!" Fudge exclaimed by way of greeting.

"Good evening, Minister," Elysia replied. "No dementor bodyguard this time?" 

Fudge scowled. "Now see here --"

She cut Fudge off by turning to the Bulgarian minister, and greeted him in his native tongue. *"Good evening, sir. I'm sorry for your loss."*

*"What loss?"*

*"Why, the hours of your life you'll never get back from having to deal with the shameless exhibition of incompetence we Brits are unfortunate enough to call our Minister."*

The Bulgarian minister and his staff roared with laughter.

*"What's this about a dementor bodyguard?"* He asked.

*"He put dementors around Hogwarts all last year,"* Elysia said. *"Nearly killed me and many other children on several occasions. And all to catch a Lord of an Ancient and Noble House who'd never even had a trial. Bit of a habit with him, from what I've seen. Makes you wonder if the man can even tie his own shoes without nearly asphyxiating himself and throwing the cobbler in prison."*

The entire Bulgarian delegation turned to face Fudge with menacing glares.

"When did you learn Bulgarian?" Hermione hissed. "And what did you say?"

"Tell you later, 'Mione," Elysia whispered back.

"Ah, Fudge," Lucius Malfoy said as he swept in with his family. Elysia was doubly disappointed, both for the presence of the Malfoys and the defusing of the rising tensions between Fudge and the Bulgarians.

Mr. Malfoy introduced his wife and son to the Minister. Draco caught sight of Elysia and blushed, but turned away with a scowl when she smirked at him.

Before tensions could ramp up again, Ludo Bagman waltzed in. "Everyone ready?" He said excitedly. 

"Please, Ludo," Fudge said.

Once everyone had finished taking their seats, Mr. Bagman cast a *sonorus* on himself and introduced the Bulgarian mascots.

The mascots turned out to be a hundred veela, who began to dance enticingly. Elysia could feel the magic of their allure tickle the edge of her mind, but it couldn't get through her occlumency shields. Still, she found the display enjoyable. Then she noticed Hermione leaning forward far enough to be dangerous, and pulled her back.

"Down, girl. You're drooling a bit," she murmured into Hermione's ear. "Put your shields up and watch the boys make fools of themselves."

Hermione's glazed look cleared up as she shook herself, and smiled thankfully at Elysia. Turning, the two of them watched as the Weasleys -- and Draco, though Lucius Malfoy, Charlie, and Mr. Weasley all seemed unaffected -- postured absurdly. Even Ginny had started to stand, when the music stopped and the veela took their places on the sidelines.

"*Ahem.* And now," Mr. Bagman said, his voice cracking at first, "the Irish National Team Mascots!"

Elysia, Hermione, and Robbie giggled to each other as everyone else seemed to shake themselves from their daze embarrassedly.

The Irish mascots, a swarm of leprechauns, put on a spectacular display of aerial acrobatics, showering the crowd with gold coins in the process. Ron hurriedly gathered up all he could, until Hermione leaned over and told him that it would disappear in a few hours anyway.

And then the game began in earnest.

It was a brutal affair, with the quaffle moving so fast it was only due to the omnioculars that anyone could keep track of it. Krum managed to pull off a Wronski Feint against Lynch, the Irish seeker, causing him to crash into the ground at full speed. Ireland began to pull ahead, and the game only got dirtier from there. Bludgers flew every which way, penalties mounted, the mascots began to fight, and finally, with the score 170 to 10 favoring Ireland, Krum managed to plow Lynch into the ground again and grab the snitch, ending the game before it could turn into a full-on rout. 

"Vell, ve fought bravely," the Bulgarian Minister said.

"You can speak English!?" Fudge said incredulously. "You've been letting me mime everything all day!"

The Bulgarian Minister shrugged. "It vos funny." 

Elysia caught his eye and burst out laughing.



+++++



They were still too keyed up when they finally made it back to camp, so they all sat around the campfire with mugs of hot cocoa.

"Harry," Hermione said, "what did you say to the Bulgarian Minister? And since when do you speak Bulgarian, anyway?"

"The 'how' is that my grandparents invented something called 'Language Lozenges[^1],'" Elysia answered, lying through her teeth. "Don't think they ever got the chance to market them; Grandmum's journal mentions them right near the end, just before they caught the dragon pox that killed them."

"So, what, you found a stash of prototypes or something?" Hermione asked.

"Yup!" Elysia said. "Russian, both Irish and Scots Gaelic, Bulgarian, Polish, Hebrew, French, Spanish... all kinds, really. It's brilliant. Maybe someday I'll be able to actually understand the formula."

Hermione nodded.

"Anyway," Elysia continued, "I took a few before I left the Dursleys. Figure, the Cup is an international event, right? Might be nice to understand some of the more international discussions."

"You're mental, mate," Ron said.

Elysia smirked. "No, 'mental' is what I said to the Bulgarian Minister." She relayed what she'd said.

"Harry James Potter! You did *not* just instigate an international incident!" Hermione admonished, laughing.

"Hey, Fudge is the dementor-happy one!" Elysia retorted. "I was just telling it like it is!"

"You have no proof of Sirius Black's innocence, Harry," Percy admonished.

"Proof?" Elysia said. "My own experiences last year aside, which I will swear to, or testify on under veritaserum? It's right there in black-and-white in my parents' wills. Which were sealed on Dumbledore's orders, by the way. And guess who cast the *Fidelius* in the first place?"

Mr. Weasley looked uncomfortable. "I'm sure he had his reasons."

Elysia scoffed. "I'm sure he did. But that doesn't change the facts. Not like I can do anything about it anyway. So how about that Wronski Feint?"

The conversation, though stilted at first, slowly grew more spirited again as they recounted the match. Until, that is, Ginny started snoring. Mr. Weasley finally sent them all to bed.

Elysia, however, remembered Janet's warning, and began carving border stones for an anti-apparition ward. When the screams started and Mr. Weasley came in to tell them all to run, she dutifully woke everyone, then told Robbie to lay the stones around the Death Eaters.

Casting a wandless illusion-construct of herself running with her friends into the woods, she shifted into a gorgon and apparated in front of the Death Eaters. In the ensuing panic, she managed to catch fully half of them in her petrifying gaze before the rest tried to apparate. When that failed, she caught another quarter of the remainder. By then ministry workers had started to arrive, so she apparated back to the tents, shifted back to Harry-shape, and popped to where her illusion-self was. All in all it took maybe five minutes.

"Harry? You okay?" Hermione called at the loud crack that sounded as Elysia joined them.

"Stepped on a branch," Elysia replied, thankful it was so dark in the woods. She'd not been missed.

"Oh, this is stupid," Hermione said, pulling out her wand. "*Lumos.*"

A beam of light shone from the tip, illuminating Draco Malfoy leaning casually against a tree.

"Careful, Granger," he taunted. "Wouldn't want to call attention to yourself with that lot. They're hunting muggles, you know."

"Hermione's a witch!" Ron growled.

"And anyway, I don't think they're hunting much of anything anymore. D'you hear any more screams? Or spellfire?" Elysia taunted. "Might want to go check on your daddy." She made her eyes flash green with a surreptitious wandless illusion, grinning maliciously at Malfoy's flinch.

Before things could escalate, they heard a hoarse shout from deeper in the woods. "*Morsmordre!*"



+++++



Later, Mr. Weasley told them that they'd found Winky the house-elf with Ron's wand, and that, while the wand showed the Dark Mark spell when checked, nobody honestly believed that either Ron (who had witnesses as to his whereabouts the whole time) nor Winky had actually cast it. Winky, who turned out to be Bartemius Crouch's elf, had been summarily given clothes and dismissed.

"It was a sorry sight," he lamented. "Poor thing was sobbing her heart out."

Eventually everything settled down enough that they could return to the tents and get some sleep. It was still an early morning, though, as Mr. Weasley woke them before sunrise to catch the return portkey back to Stoatshead Hill.

A distraught Mrs. Weasley greeted them on their return, waving the morning edition of the Daily Prophet. The headline blared: "DARK MARK OVER WORLD CUP! DEATH EATERS PETRIFIED UNDER MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES!"

"Arthur!" She called out as they approached. "Is everyone okay?"

"Fine, Molly," he replied. "It was the strangest thing. By the time we got to the Death Eaters, they were almost all petrified. Oh, there were a few left, but none of them even tried to disapparate. We managed to catch every single one, aside from whoever conjured that Dark Mark."

*Did you manage to clear out the anti-apparition stones before the clean-up crew got there?* Elysia asked Robbie over their bond.

*Yup!* He answered proudly.

*Awesome! Thanks, bro!*

"What're you grinning about?" Ron asked suspiciously.

"Mr. Weasley," Elysia asked, with a pointed look at Ron. "Was one of those caught a certain Lucius Malfoy, by any chance?"

A look of understanding dawned on Ron's face.

"Well," Mr. Weasley replied, "can't say for sure. Ongoing investigation and all, y'see, and none of them have been un-petrified yet. But I wouldn't be surprised," he said with malicious glee. "Rumor has it that the Malfoys had broken camp sometime in the night, and aren't reachable this morning."

Everyone in earshot smirked at that, even Mrs. Weasley. There was no love lost between the two families.

The moment was broken when Elysia let out an enormous yawn, and Mrs. Weasley sent them all up to bed. Elysia realized she'd not had a proper night's sleep in two days, and was out as soon as her head hit the pillow.

## Chapter 8: The New Girl

The remainder of the summer passed quickly. Percy and Mr. Weasley were at the Ministry more often than not, dealing with the aftermath of the World Cup and the Death Eaters.

Much to the delight of everyone, Lucius Malfoy had indeed been one of those petrified in full Death Eater regalia. He, along with the rest of those captured, were sentenced to five years for muggle-baiting and causing an international incident, among other things -- they all were raided by the DMLE for cause, as well.

"Couldn't happen to a nicer bloke," Ron said when he heard.

"Wonder how Draco's going to handle it," Elysia mused. "I imagine either he'll be keeping his head down or he'll be on a hair-trigger."

The other big thing that happened occurred at dinner the day after they returned from the World Cup, after Hermione had relayed the relevant part of her and Ginny's conversation from the other night.

"Hey, everyone? This summer's been an interesting one, and I've learned a lot about myself. And I need to share one of those things with you all." She took a deep breath. "I'm a girl. My name's Elysia now, or Ellie for short."

"Well *that* figures," Ginny said, then blushed deeply when she realized she'd said it out loud.

Ron looked conflicted, alternating between relief and worry. Elysia, noticing, grinned. "Steady on," she told him. "Still not into blokes."

Hermione got a thoughtful look on her face. "So what're you going to do about Hogwarts?"

Elysia hummed. "Good question. I suppose I should write Professor McGonagall again."

"Again?" Asked Fred. "And why --"

"-- would you be --" George continued.

"-- writing our esteemed professor --"

"-- this summer?"

"Because I wanted out of Divination," Elysia answered. "She said I can test into Arithmancy and Runes, and if I do I can drop Divination."

"Well, we'll move you into Ginny's room with the other girls while you're here, dear," Mrs. Weasley said.

"Have you gone shopping for girl clothes yet?" Ginny asked.

"Some," Elysia shrugged. "I rather like the androgynous look, though. It gets some pretty great reactions."

Every single Weasley in the room except the adults blushed bright red at that. 

Hermione couldn't keep the smirk from her face. "It kind of says, 'I don't care what your sexuality is, you're definitely questioning it now.'"

Elysia raised an eyebrow at her, grinning. "Oh *really?*"

Hermione blushed the brightest of them all.



+++++



Elysia wrote Professor McGonagall (and Sirius, while she was at it) as soon as dinner was finished. The next day, her answer came while Elysia and Hermione were sitting in the back garden, going over what Elysia would need for the Arithmancy and Runes qualifiers. The Weasleys gave them a wide berth; none of them wanted to spend the last few precious days of summer *studying.*

> Ms. Potter,
>
> Thank you for informing me of this change. I'll update your file and accommodations accordingly. Will you be undergoing the transition ritual at St. Mungo's before term starts?
>
>  -- Prof. Minerva McGonagall
>   Deputy Headmistress
>   Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry

"There's a ritual for that?" Hermione asked.

"Apparently," Elysia said. "I'll just tell her yes. No need to tip my hand about the shifting just yet. D'you think I should change my hair, though?"

"How do you mean?" Hermione asked.

In answer, Elysia shifted her still-short hair to auburn, then shifted some black streaks in, then shifted to black hair with auburn tips.

"Oh, I like that last one," Hermione said. "It's quite striking."

Elysia shifted back. "I'll have to duck out for a day to give myself an alibi, then. Robbie can take me; that should reassure Mrs. Weasley."

"What are you going to *actually* do?" Hermione asked.

"Well, you *do* have a birthday coming up..."



+++++

### Hogwarts Express    1994/09/01  10:50

Despite Mr. Weasley being called into work for an emergency that morning, they still made it to Platform 9^3/4^ with 10 minutes to spare. As they made their way down the train, Fred and George broke off to sit with Lee Jordan and the girls from the Gryffindor quidditch team. Elysia, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny continued on, finding that all of the compartments were full.

Finally, they came to one with only a single occupant: a girl with long, pale blonde hair and wide blue eyes, wearing a Ravenclaw tie, who was reading a magazine upside-down.

"Hello, Luna," Ginny said, opening the door. "May we join you?"

Luna looked up from the magazine she was reading. "Certainly," she replied in a dreamy voice.

"Everyone, this is Luna Lovegood. She's in my year," Ginny said, introducing them to Luna as they all filed in.

Elysia took the seat next to Luna, with Hermione on her other side and Ron and Ginny across from them.

"Whatcha reading?" She asked, leaning over.

Luna smiled absently. "The Quibbler. My father runs it."

"Neat," Elysia said. "Ooh, is that a rune puzzle?"

"So *that's* why it's upside-down," Hermione muttered under her breath.

"Yes," Luna said airily. Hermione blushed at being overheard. "Mother was a spell-crafter before she died, and she taught me Runes and Arithmancy ever since I was old enough to remember."

"I'm starting those subjects this year," Elysia said. "Professor McGonagall let me test into the 4^th^-year classes."

"Me too!" Luna exclaimed, pleased. "Well, I have yet to take the qualifying exams, of course, but I don't expect any problems."

"Same," Elysia said. "Hermione's made sure I haven't missed anything."

The three began discussing both Runes and Arithmancy with much enthusiasm. Ron and Ginny looked at each other in bemusement.

A few minutes later, Neville Longbottom joined them, taking the empty seat between Ron and Ginny. The discussion was already going so strongly, none of the three even noticed at first, until Neville spoke up to say hello.

"Oh, hullo, Nev," Elysia said.

Neville blushed. "Do I know you -- *Harry!?*"

"It's Elysia now," she replied. 

"Oh," Neville said faintly.

"Hi, Neville," Hermione said, stifling a giggle. "How was your summer?"



+++++



A ride on the Hogwarts Express wasn't complete without Draco Malfoy stopping by to make a nuisance of himself.

"Potter!" He blustered, banging open the door to their compartment. "Um..."

Elysia stood, and prowled to the door. Draco gulped.

"Hello, *Draco,*" She growled. She ran a finger across his jaw, channeling a Jelly-Legs Jinx. He flushed as his knees gave out and he tumbled out into the hallway, knocking over Crabbe and Goyle. Elysia smirked, slammed the door shut, and locked it with several locking charms. "Goodbye, Draco!"

As she retook her seat, the compartment exploded in laughter.



+++++



The rest of the trip passed uneventfully, though pleasantly. Elysia's newfound confidence helped draw out the normally-shy Neville, and Luna found much in the way of common ground with both Elysia and Hermione. Her tendency to talk about creatures nobody else could see, or believed existed, notwithstanding, she easily kept pace with the two older girls intellectually.

Finally, they arrived at Hogsmeade Station and disembarked, with a wave to Hagrid which made the large man do a double-take. As the six of them approached the horseless carriages, Luna made a detour to the front of one, tugging Hermione's hand.

"Here, pet this," she said, placing Hermione's hand on *something.* Elysia raised an eyebrow. While she couldn't *see* anything, it was apparent that Hermione could *feel* something under her hand.

"Luna, I..." Hermione said. "I'm sorry I doubted you. What *are* they?"

"They're thestrals," Luna answered softly.

"I know about those!" Neville said. "You can only see them if you've seen someone die."

"Yes," Luna said wistfully. "They have a bad reputation because of that. But really they're quite gentle."

Elysia stepped closer to pet the thestral. Luna guided her hand to its flank. "It's kind of leathery, but soft," she told the others. 

Hermione had stepped back and was studying Luna. "Your mother?"

Luna nodded. "When I was nine. There was nothing I could do."

Hermione gently hugged the younger girl. "I'm sorry," she said softly.

They filed into the carriage after a last pat for the loyal thestral, and made their way up to the castle.



+++++



The storm that had been threatening all day finally broke on the short trek up from Hogsmeade, and despite the short dash from the carriages to the entry hall, they were all soaked to the skin by the time they made it indoors.

Just when they thought they were safe, water balloons began pelting them from above, soaking them once more -- not that Elysia felt it made much difference, really.

"PEEVES!" McGonagall yelled, dashing out of the great hall. 

After chasing Peeves off, the students were ushered into the Great Hall.

"Great, now I'm soggy *and* starving," Ron grumbled. The others could only agree.

Luna split off to the Ravenclaw table, and the others took seats midway down the Gryffindor table. Elysia scanned the staff table, noting that there were more empty seats than usual. One, she presumed, was Prof. McGonagall's, and another was Hagrid's, as both were busy with the first-years. And then it clicked: the remaining empty seat was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

"Wonder who they got for DADA this year," she murmured to the others.

"Maybe they couldn't find anyone," Hermione said pensively.

"Maybe Peeves got them," Ron said. "Wish they'd hurry up with the sorting, I'm ravenous!"

Elysia scanned the staff table again, and caught the eye of Professor Snape. She'd seen plenty of people do double-takes over her this summer, but this was the first time she'd someone pale so drastically at the same time. *Looks like he's seen a ghost,* she thought to herself.

Prof. McGonagall entered with the first-years, and as Hagrid took his seat the Sorting commenced. It was the first one since Elysia's own that she'd managed to see, as the past two years something had always come up. Colin Creevy's little brother, Dennis, was sorted into Gryffindor, and Elysia giggled to herself as Colin tried to point out 'the famous Harry Potter' to him but didn't recognize her.

The Sorting wrapped up, and the feast appeared. Everyone dove in with relish, and Elysia pondered how it was that she could be so hungry after stuffing herself silly with snacks on the train ride.

Finally, dessert was devoured and the plates cleared. Dumbledore stood, and gave out his usual start-of-term notices. "It is my painful duty to inform you that there will be no Inter-House Quidditch Cup this year," he added, amid rising murmurs of shock and dismay from across the Hall, "due to an event starting this Halloween and continuing through the rest of the year. It is my great pleasure to announce that this year, Hogwarts --"

Several things happened at once, and Elysia couldn't help but admire the theatricality of it all. Thunder crashed, the doors to the Great Hall flew open, and a bolt of lightning flashed in the enchanted ceiling, illuminating a figure who looked as if he'd been born to the storm. His face was scarred, weathered, and craggy, with one piercing blue eye, which rolled around independently of the other, which was a beady black and much more normal for all that. He had a peg leg, shaggy hair the dark grey of storm-clouds, and a black travelling cloak billowing in the door's backdraft. All in all, Elysia thought even Snape would be hard-pressed to make a more dramatic entrance.

The figure made his way down the Hall to Prof. Dumbledore, with whom he spoke quietly for a moment before taking the vacant DADA seat at the staff table.

"May I introduce Alastor Moody," Prof. Dumbledore said, "our new professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts."

The students' whispering among themselves reached a crescendo. Moody himself ignored them, and looked to be casting detection spells on his dinner. As Elysia watched, he took as swig from a hip flask.

"*Mad-Eye* Moody?" Ron said incredulously. "*That's* our new DADA professor?"

"The one your dad was called about this morning?" Hermione inquired.

Ron nodded. "That's him. He's supposed to be a legendary auror; caught more than his fair share of Death Eaters back in the war."

"As I was saying," Dumbledore was saying, "Hogwarts will this year play host to the newly-reconstituted Tri-Wizard Tournament."

A chill of foreboding trickled down Elysia's spine.

The conversation was of the upcoming tournament as they all made their way to Gryffindor Tower. Ron and the twins were lamenting that they were too young, and discussing schemes to get around the Headmaster's Age Line.

"Better you than me, mate," Elysia said. "I'd rather a nice normal year for once."

Elysia almost followed Ron to the boys' dorms, but remembered at the last minute and turned to follow Hermione instead. *That's going to take some getting used to,* she thought to herself.

The girls' dorms were a mirror image to the boys' dorms. Hermione had the bed by the window, and Elysia's bed had been inserted between hers and Parvati Patil's.

"I was wondering whose bed that was," Parvati said. "Hello, new girl!"

Elysia grinned as she loosened her tie. "Hullo, Parvati. How was your summer?"

Parvati squinted at her. "How do you know my name -- wait a minute. *Harry!?*"

"It's Elysia now," she responded. "Or Ellie for short. Turns out that was a nickname of my mum's back in the day."

"Damn," Parvati said. "Right heart-breaker, you are. D'you have any idea how many girls are going to be disappointed that you've turned out to be a girl?"

Lavender Brown came in from the bathroom, took one look at Elysia, blushed furiously, and ducked back into the bathroom.

Elysia smirked. "Probably not that one?"

Hermione couldn't contain her giggles anymore. "That never gets old, Ellie!"

Elysia waggled her eyebrows at her, and over passive legilimency, sent, *especially when it's you doing the blushing.*

Hermione's eyes widened and she squeaked, flushing deeply. "Um. I." Her brow furrowed and she squeezed her eyes shut. "Damn it, Ellie!"

Elysia laughed. "Language, 'Mione!"

Parvati giggled. "Woah, there, Heart-Breaker. You still need to sleep here, y'know."

Elysia favored her with a raised eyebrow. "What'd *I* do?"

Parvati crossed her arms and mock-glared. "You know what you did, young lady," she said sternly, waggling a finger. All three of them burst into giggles as Lavender braved joining them again, mock-pouting.

"It's just plain *unfair,*" she said, flopping down on the bed nearest the door. "You were so striking as a boy, and now you're *this* cute? The boys won't know what hit them."

"Ugh, do I give off straight vibes?" Elysia grumbled.

"Well, no, not so much I suppose," Lavender answered. "But you know how boys are."

"I guess," Elysia said. "Can't say they've ever made much sense to me."

"'Straight vibes?' Wait a minute..." Lavender said, then promptly blushed again.

"How *do* you flag for Sapphic-ness in the magical world?" Hermione mused. "In the muggle world there's things like accent nails and the handkerchief code."

"Short fingernails?" Lavender shrugged. They all blushed as the implications hit.

"Dunno that anyone thinks enough of it to feel like they need to," Parvati mused. "Signaling's a thing for muggles because of the controversy, right? But it's not controversial for us, so no need to be covert about things."

"It's more about how you behave and who you flirt with," Lavender added. "Though that tomboy look you've got is uncommon enough that you'll probably get lots of attention from everyone anyway."

Elysia hummed. "Y'know, normally I don't like to stand out. But it's kind of fun when it's not because of that Boy-Who-Lived stuff, or because people are afraid of me, like when everyone thought I was the Heir of Slytherin. Hey, Lavender, Parvati?" She asked. "Can you not let everyone know about my transition? I want to enjoy their individual reactions while I can." She grinned mischievously.

"Sure thing, Heart-Breaker," Parvati said, grinning back. "This is gonna be *good.*"
