# The List

## Summary

Harry is a trans girl, and ends up in the Afterlife (which looks suspiciously like The Good Place). The usual Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper challenge ensues, with a... _twist_ or two.

### Reptilia28 Don't Fear the Reaper Challenge Details

> Harry is killed at 17 during the fight with Voldemort. He's sent to his Death's office (explained later) and finds out that this isn't the first time that this has happened.
>
> Harry's Death (who can have a human name) is mad at his arrival. Apparently, people dying before their time is a black mark on the various Deaths' records, and Harry is getting  perilously close to getting this particular one fired.
>
> When Harry asks what was supposed to have happened, Death goes off on a rant saying how he was supposed to have killed Voldemort, found his soulmate ("Some Granger girl…") and lived to be a centennial age.  But since Harry keeps getting into life-threatening situations for one reason or another, he keeps dying before that happens. Harry is surprised about the soul mate part.
> Death gives Harry a paper to sign that allows him to retain his memories (the previous times, he wasn't given this option for some reason). Harry is deposited to a previous time of the writer's choosing.
> Eventually, Harry gets it right. He kills Voldemort, gets the girl, and lives to a ripe old age of whatever. And Death doesn't get fired.
>
> REQUIREMENTS:
> Harry must have died at least three times before this one. The memory keeping contract must  be included. Death must refer to Hermione as "some Granger girl" when Harry's soul mate turns up in his rant. Obviously, must at least be Harmony.
>
> OPTIONAL: Dumbledore's manipulations can be a factor in Harry's premature demises.

### Changes and Adjustments

> + Can't keep timeline memories, but can train up in the afterlife and keep that. 
>   + Training includes mind magics 
> + Can make a plan with whichever advisors are desired. The plan lives in Harry's mindscape and can only be accessed during occlumentic meditation.
> + No way is Eleanor getting fired, but she's a romantic at heart (and *really* wants to hook up with Destiny if she can help her latest pet project along).
> + Voldemort's defeat is not the reason for being sent back. Magic is dying out due to a stagnant and oppressive society, and Harry is uniquely placed to fix it -- by any means necessary.

## Chapter 1: Making Memories

### ?????	????/??/??	??:??

The first thing Harry saw was a white wall with green letters, which said, *Welcome! Everything is fine.*

*That's nice,* Harry thought. *I wonder where I am, though?* The room looked like a generic waiting room in a generic office, with a generic sofa facing the wall with its soothing message.

*For that matter,* Harry thought, *how did I get here? The last thing I remember was... Voldemort. And the Forbidden Forest, and a green light... He spouted some cliché line, too. What was it again? Oh, right. "Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived. Come to die."* Something about those words made Harry very uncomfortable, but she couldn't quite... wait a minute. *She!?*

"... Oh." Harry looked down at herself, and realized that for the first time she felt comfortable in her own skin.

Of course, the fact that she was wearing clothes that actually *fit* for once didn't hurt either.

A door opened off to the left, and a voice startled her out of her reverie.

"Ms. Potter? We're ready for you."



+++++



"Harry? Hi, I'm Eleanor," the blonde behind the desk said. "Have a seat and we'll get started."

Harry sat. The chair was surprisingly comfy.

Eleanor opened a folder on the desk, which Harry didn't think was there a second ago.

"So. First things first. You, Harry James Potter, are dead."

Harry sat up with a start. "Wait, what?"

Eleanor stared across the desk with an amused quirk of the eyebrow. "Again. You've died kind of a lot, huh? Not that it's really your fault. Your enemies cheat like my ex. This time they even got you to walk right into a Killing Curse, voluntarily. Not your best moment, though you *did* score major points for selflessness. Or, you would have, if it had made any difference at all. Sorry, kid, your heroic sacrifice was for nothin'."

Harry's jaw dropped. "You mean Voldemort *won!?*" She buried her face in her hands and growl-screamed into them.

"'Fraid so, kiddo. But don't worry! We got that horcrux out of you and you're in the Good Place now. Well, for the moment."

Harry looked up, hands still poised in case of further bouts of screaming. "For the moment?"

Eleanor sighed, and drummed her hands on the desk. "Look, kid, I'm going to level with you. Most people, they kick the bucket, show up here or " -- she blew a raspberry and gave a thumbs-down -- "the Bad Place, work through a few Purgatory cycles, and move on. You're not most people. You got whammied by Destiny, so you get to go back and try again until you get whatever Destiny has in store for you out of the way." 

Harry put her face back in her hands and growl-screamed again.

Eleanor flipped through the folder. "Lessee here. Ooh, tough break, kid," she winced. "Destiny's kind of cruel sometimes. Don't tell her I said that, though; still trying to get her to hook up with me. She can *rock* that LBD, y'know what I'm sayin'?" She winked in exaggerated fashion.

Harry snorted into her hands and looked up with a surprised giggle.

"Anyway," Eleanor continued, "that Vole-dee-mort guy. Sounds like a rodent. Ya gotta *exterminate* him before you can get to the good stuff, which means *you* get to go back. Again. Geez, what is this, your twelfth time?"

Harry shrugged. "I don't remember."

"Oh, right, that whole wipe-your-memory-so-you-don't-break-spacetime thing." Eleanor groused. "Sorry about that. Not my call. I'm just filling in for Michael this go-round," she continued, *sotto voce.* "Poor guy gets a little stir-crazy every few Beremies."

Finally starting to relax, Harry settled back into her chair again. "So, um..." she started. "What's next? Actually, wait. First, why am I a girl? Or, why was I a guy? Or... whatever." She waved a hand vaguely. "Not that I'm complaining now, but what the *fork?*" Her eyes widened. "Fork? Why can't I say 'fork?'"

Eleanor grinned. "Yeah, that's from the first draft of the Good Place. We all thought it was funny, so it kind of just stuck around. And you've always been a girl, Harry. You just never got the chance to show it back on Earth. Blame Bumblesnore, or whatever his name is, for that. Devious little shirt was worse than that Vole guy, in some ways." She flipped through the folder again. "Wow, what a jerk! Talked you into eating that AK, left you to rot in Durzkaban, kept all *kinds* of secrets from you, potioned up you and your potential soul-mates to keep you apart -- especially that Granger girl." She looked up, eyes blazing. "Sean's going to have a *field day* with him."

"Hermione?" Harry blurted. "*She's* my soul-mate?"

"*Potential* soul-mate. You've run across a few, looks like. It really just means that you're super-compatible and you *get* each other. Or *can,* eventually. Looks like that Lovegood girl's another one."

"*Luna!?*" Harry squeaked.

"Yup!" Eleanor chirped. "Ooh, and they're both potentials for each other, too. How's *that* for good luck?" She winked at Harry again, and waggled her eyebrows outrageously.

Harry blushed beet-red. "I... I... Um..."

"Woah, easy there, Beyoncé," Eleanor grinned.

Harry just looked confused.

"Beyoncé? Like, Destiny's Child? Because you're a Child of Destiny?"

Harry looked even more confused, somehow. Eleanor sighed. "Jeez, kid, get a radio."

Harry shook her head. Pulling herself together finally, she asked, "So, what, I need to go back, kill the Dark Plonker once and for all, get the girl -- girls? -- *be* a girl, and live to a ripe old age? How am I supposed to do that if I keep forgetting everything every time I go back?"

"Oh, your destiny's bigger than _that._" Eleanor thought for a minute, then grinned. "So we're gonna cheat like mad. And remember, vengeance is a dish best served when they don't see it coming. Oh, Janet!"



+++++



Janet, it turned out, was a hyper-evolved sentient interface to the sum total of all knowledge in the universe -- and an absolute sweetheart too. Between the three of them, a plan was soon formed.

"Just sign here, here, and here," Janet said, handing Harry a contract. "This should keep the Judge happy. It says that, while you won't remember your last life, you can keep your training from here in the Good Place in your subconscious, and a plan of action in your occlumency mindscape. Basically, you'll get mind magic training first, and everything after that gets tucked away in the mindscape you'll build as part of that. You'll still have any instincts and muscle memory that result from any training you do here, and the actual knowledge will come to you if you focus on it. But you won't really remember your time here, or anything like that. Just your training, and not as lived experience. It might feel weird at first when you go back."

Harry smiled nervously. "It's better than going back blind like before, I suppose."

"Right?" Eleanor said. "Well! That's settled. Let's get to it! Janet made a sweet little place for you to train, and... 'live,' I guess? I mean, you're dead, but..."

"The word you're looking for is 'reside,' Eleanor," Janet interjected with a smile.

"Thanks, babe," Eleanor said. "Anyway, she named it Elysium after some ancient Greek idea of a hero's afterlife. Seemed fitting."



+++++



"This. Is. Awesome!" Harry gushed, looking around her own personal Elysium. There was a cozy-looking cottage, some lightly-forested grounds at the edge of a crystal-clear lake, and a *quidditch pitch!* The lake had a small cabana on its beach, a fire pit next to some log benches, and a few large boulders perfect for sunning or diving. The grounds had a large grassy clearing, with a perfectly round border of white stone.

Janet had a smug smile, and Eleanor was grinning like a Cheshire cat. "Wait 'til you see the inside!"

They walked into the cottage and Harry *squealed.*

"Oh Merlin, it's *wonderful!*"

The door opened into a main room with a sunken den area, ringed with squashy sofas, facing a hearth with several hooks on swiveling arms mounted to one side. Through one doorway was a roomy, well-appointed kitchen with plenty of counter space, and through another was a huge, well-lit study, with shelves and shelves of books, big bay windows with reading nooks, a large desk, and several squashy armchairs. A door in the kitchen turned out to be a staircase down to a basement workshop, with fully-appointed potions and enchanting areas. Last there was a door across the den area which led to a large bedroom with a king-size four-poster bed, with French doors opening onto a deck facing the lake. Across from the French doors was a bathroom with a sunken jacuzzi tub. The whole place had a cozy, rustic aesthetic which Harry found thoroughly comforting.

"I should hope so," Janet said. "I got it from your past lives' daydreams about having a place of your own. With a few modifications for the training you'll be undertaking, of course."

"Oh, right. About that," Harry said. "What's the plan?"

Janet and Eleanor looked at each other and grinned.

"Turn you into a force of nature. Montage?"

"Montage."



+++++



Time, such as it was in the Afterlife, passed in a blur. (And frequently with an '80s-rock-inspired backing track, courtesy of Janet.)

It wasn't all training, either. Since it *was* the Afterlife, after all, Harry could meet with other dead people. She got to train with some of the greatest witches and wizards who ever lived, and several mundane masters as well (Bruce Lee was a particular favourite). But she also got to spend time with her parents. 

James and Lily were both brilliant and terrifying, though each had their specialties. And it turned out that both were exceptional at flying, both with a broom and without. One of the perks of being dead, apparently, was that gravity was more of a suggestion than an actual law. Not to mention animagus training; while neither James nor Lily had flight-capable forms, Harry was a peregrine falcon. Because of course she was. Lily named the form Nemesis, after the Greek goddess of retribution. (James made a comment about "screaming for vengeance," and thus Harry's education in music began, starting with Judas Priest for obvious reasons.)

And speaking of shape-shifting, Harry was also a latent metamorphmagus. The overnight hair-growth incident after a bad haircut during Harry's childhood had been an unmistakable sign, if only anyone had known to look. Oh, she wasn't nearly as innately talented at it as, say, Tonks, but the possibility was there, and so she was trained in that too. This, coupled with her animagus training, of course led to some interesting possibilities which were thoroughly explored.

She trained in mental magic, myriad styles of martial arts and dueling, melee weapons, archery, firearms, spell-crafting, wandless magic, wards, enchanting, engineering, math, science, logic, rhetoric, etiquette, politics, diplomacy, history, and many *many* other subjects. Her tutors crammed her brain full of every last bit of knowledge, skill, and instinct they thought could possibly be beneficial. If she hadn't already been dead, she felt that it might've killed her all over again.

Eventually, after a time impossible to quantify by mortal standards, she was ready.



## Chapter 2: Keep In Mind

### #4 Privet Drive, Surrey	1994/06/26	04:30

Harry woke with a start. 

Fading moonlight streamed through the window, making the sleeping Hedwig's feathers glow softly. 

Checking the time on the battered old alarm clock Dudley had thrown against the wall one morning because he hadn't wanted to get up for school, Harry saw that it was still a couple of hours before sunrise. Hogwarts had let out only yesterday, and normally he slept like the dead that first night back.

Wait, *'he?'* Why did that feel so much more uncomfortable than usual?

A sudden headache stabbed his brain all over, and he fell back to the mattress with a groan.

"Hi, I'm Janet!"

"Aagh!" Harry yelped, jolting upright. She looked around in a confused panic. *Wait, 'she?'*

She found herself sprawled on an almost unnaturally green lawn, with a rustic-looking cottage to one side and a lake-side cabana to the other. Standing over her was a pretty brunette with a clipboard.

Harry scrambled to her feet as the brunette -- Janet, presumably -- continued speaking. "Welcome to your mindscape, your own personal Elysium!"

"We -- we're in my mind?" Harry asked.

"Yup!" Janet chirped. "And I'm a personification of your subconscious. Walk with me, Harry." She started towards the cottage. "Long story short, you died. Again. We decided to give you an edge on your next life through -- since clearly you can't rely on the adults in your life to do anything but screw you over or get in the way, we decided to make you as self-sufficient as possible. And all this," she waved vaguely around at the cottage they'd just entered, "is part of that." She sat primly on one of the squashy sofas near the hearth and patted the seat next to her.

Harry sat. "So... why am I a girl here?"

"We're in *your* head, Harry. You tell me," Janet answered.

"... Oh. Huh. That explains a lot, I guess. So I'm dead?"

"No, not anymore, Harry," Janet replied. "You got sent back to get it right this time. You can't remember the past lives, though, because it would destroy the space-time continuum, so we sort of *cheated.* A little bit."

Harry raised an eyebrow.

"Okay, fine, _a lot._ It's all here," Janet continued. "You left yourself a to-do list and some pointers. Most of the training-specific stuff is tucked away in your subconscious, tied to specific triggers; we didn't want to overwhelm you. But there are a couple of things you need to know up front."

"Like that I'm a girl?" Harry asked.

"No, that one was going to bubble up around this time in your life regardless. Puberty, don'tcha know. But before, you were so intent on not standing out that you just repressed it for the rest of your life. Now, though, since thanks to your between-lives training you can do something about it, we tied this first mindscape entrance to that realization as a trigger to bring you here."

"Really?" Harry said. A cold prickling sensation washed over her scalp. "Wait, don't tell me. I'm a shape-shifter, right?"

Janet stood with a smile. "Pretty much! Come on, it's time to show you the study."

They went down the hallway to a huge room filled with books, expansive bay windows with cozy-looking reading nooks, a substantial desk, and a floor safe tucked away in a corner. A black leather binder was sitting on the desk. Janet gestured to it. "Here's The List!" Elysia could hear the capital letters. "It's full of useful foreknowledge, but you'll only be able to read the parts you can act on or already know about at any given time. Too much future knowledge can mess you up. Your last self said it wouldn't do to have you too far out of sync with your peers; after all, you're too isolated as it is."

Harry nodded and opened the binder.

"The primers contain the sum total of knowledge and training from your afterlife on that subject," Janet said. "You and your advisors decided the first order of business was a degree of independence, so everything on this first list is to make you more capable of fending for yourself without setting off the Trace or relying on the adults in your life who have proven less than helpful."

"Dobby, huh?" Harry said. "Why didn't I think of that?"

"You did," Janet smirked. "Anyway, as the personification of your subconscious, I can dig up anything in your mind you ask me to, unless there's a good reason not to. If that's the case, I'll tell you so."

"Thanks, Janet," Harry smiled.

Janet waved a hand, and a pile of books appeared next to one of the reading nooks. Harry spent the next little while flipping through them, realizing that far more knowledge was pouring into her mind than was written on the page. By the time she was finished with the first book, she understood why.

"Bloody hell!" Harry exclaimed. "What a rush!"

"Wait 'til you read the next set," Janet grinned.

Harry dove right in, with a fervor that would have put Hermione Granger to shame.

"Woah," Harry said when she finally came up for air. "I know kung fu."

Janet placed a steadying hand on Harry's shoulder. "Now, remember, you don't have the physical or magical development yet to take full advantage of all you've just learned. Go slowly at first."

Harry nodded, with a huge grin on her face. "That's what the training regimen is for, yeah?"

Janet nodded. "You'll want to take care of the Gringotts business first, so you and Dobby can get any equipment you'll need."

"Gotcha."

Harry dove back in.

"The sun's coming up, Harry," Janet said as Harry finished the last of the books. 

"What, barely? I've been here for hours!" Harry exclaimed. "Wait, I remember now. Time's different in a mind-scape, isn't it?"

"It is," Janet confirmed. "But that's all the books on that first list, so I'd say we timed things out rather well, wouldn't you?"

"You -- I -- we *timed* this? Merlin!"

"He helped."

"I.... sort of remember that?" Harry said hesitantly. "Like a dream, almost."

"You weren't allowed to keep most of your memories of the afterlife," Janet reminded her. "Some of them, yes, such as that needed to effectively use your training, and a few of the people you trained with. Merlin, Morgana, Bruce Lee, the Founders... you'll remember bits and pieces, especially if it becomes relevant, but the only clear memories you were allowed to keep were of your parents."

"My... my parents?" Harry stammered.

"Go look in the bedroom," Janet replied with a soft smile.



+++++



The bedroom, it turned out, was empty. The deck beyond the French doors, however, was not.

"Mum? Dad?" Harry choked out, rushing to the deck.

James and Lily Potter turned and engulfed their child in a crushing hug.

Eventually, Harry pulled herself together. "You... aren't really here, are you? You're just personifications of my afterlife memories of you?"

"Pretty much," James shrugged. "But there're a lot of those. Enough for us to *effectively* be here for you in Elysium, your mindscape, even if the real us can't be. Those versions of us are watching over you, though. You can be sure of that."

"We're so proud of you, honey!" Lily cried, squeezing Harry again. Harry squeezed back.

A trickle of memories crawled over Harry's scalp, helping to temper her emotions at seeing her parents again. *For the first time in this lifetime,* her memories whispered, *but not the last. They're right here!* She squeezed them one last time. "I guess it's time to get things moving," she said.

Her parents nodded, her dad with a devilish grin and her mom with a decidedly Slytherin smirk. "They won't know what hit them, Nemesis," Lily said.

James patted her on the back. "Go get 'em, kiddo!'"



## Chapter 3: Ellie And Robbie

Opening her eyes with a start, Harry looked down at herself. She was in boy-mode again; as uncomfortable as it was, she knew she would have to stay boy-shaped for awhile. All the more reason to get some independence, she supposed.

She went through her morning routine, including the silent treatment at breakfast with the Dursleys, then dug out her Gringotts key and money pouch and headed to the park down Wisteria Walk. Tucking herself away among a cluster of bushes, she called out softly, "Dobby!"

With a quiet *pop,* Dobby the House-Elf appeared. "Great Harry Potter Sir is calling for Dobby!" He gushed, bowing so low that his long, floppy ears brushed the ground.

"Dobby," Harry said, "How would you like to be my elf?"

Dobby nodded frantically, so overcome he could only squeak.

"Dobby, I claim you as my elf," Harry said, remembering the formal oath from her earlier reading. "My magic to your magic, my strength to your strength, my knowledge to your knowledge, my secrets to your secrets. Henceforth, you shall be known as a Potter elf. And as a part of my family," Harry added, though this wasn't in the formal oath. "So mote it be!"

A soft glow surrounded the two for a moment, and as it faded Dobby leapt to embrace Harry.

"*Family* to the Great Harry Potter! And so much *knowledge!* Dobby is... *overwhelmed!*"

Harry hugged back and smiled. "Me too, Dobby. We're going to really shake things up together, you and I."

"Great Harry Potter Miss has plans?"

Harry thought for a second. "First, Dobby, nobody else knows I'm a girl yet, and I want to keep it that way for now. Just call me Harry. We *are* family now, after all."

Dobby nodded, tears in his eyes and a smile on his face.

"Second," Harry continued, "I know that your speech patterns are because of your time with the Malfoys, but you're part of the Potter family now. You're not a servant, not a lesser being. You are a Potter, and as such you're expected to stand tall and speak with confidence."

"I understand, Harry," Dobby said.

"I'm still working on that myself," Harry mused with a smile. "We can help each other out on that, yeah?"

"Okay," Dobby agreed.

"Thanks, Dobby. Now, I've got some plans for today. I want to end the day with more independence than I started it with, and the next step is to see what resources we have. So we're off to Gringotts," Harry said. "What do you think is the best way to do this? The Knight Bus, maybe?"

"Dobby can -- err, *I* can bring you straight to Gringotts, Harry. We elves has -- *have* our own kind of magic. Like apparition, only not, you see."

"That sounds good," Harry replied. "Shall we?" 

Dobby wrapped Harry in a hug, and they were off to Diagon Alley.

> To Do

> - [x] Bond with Dobby as your house elf



They reappeared with a *pop* in a cordoned-off section of the Gringotts lobby, and Dobby immediately dragged Harry over to one of the lines. "So the next person doesn't be landing on you," he said. After a short wait, they got to a teller, who glared down at them from the abnormally high counter.

"Yes?" The goblin asked, in a rather put-out voice.

"May blood and gold flow at your feet. I'd like a full accounting of my holdings, please," Harry said.

"Key?" The goblin said shortly.

Harry handed over the key. The goblin took it and did something behind the counter, then handed it back. "Lockjaw will take you to an account manager. Lockjaw!"

Another goblin, Lockjaw presumably, led them through an opulent door into a maze of opulent hallways. Eventually, they came to another opulent door, which Lockjaw led them through before ducking back out.

Another goblin, built like a gnarled old oak tree with a bushy white beard, was seated behind a desk, with a gas-lamp and several ledgers on it. He gestured to the chairs in front of the desk and introduced himself. "I am Claymore, the account manager for the Potter estate. I wasn't expecting you for a few more years, Mr. Potter."

Harry inwardly cringed at being addressed as 'Mr.' but shrugged it off. *Not yet,* she told herself. "Harry is fine, Claymore," she told the goblin. "May this meeting bring profit to our clans and ruin to our enemies." So saying, she had a seat in one chair and gestured for Dobby to take the other. "This is Dobby, my friend and advisor."

"Well met, Harry, Dobby. What brings you to Gringotts today?"

"I recently came to the conclusion that I have been far too reactive in my life thus far, and have decided to do something about it. The first step, then, is to take stock. So my first order of business is a full accounting of my available assets. Depending on the results, we'll go from there."

Claymore nodded and, after digging around in a desk drawer for a moment, produced a small, ornate stiletto dagger; a roll of parchment; a small screw-top inkwell; and a red quill. "Well then, Harry, what say we start with a lineage trace?" He screwed the inkwell onto the dagger's hilt and gestured for the back of Harry's hand. After passing the blade through the gas-lamp's flame several times, he gently slid the point into a vein. The stiletto blade, it turned out, was hollow, and Harry's blood began to fill the inkwell. 

Once it filled, Harry shifted the wound closed. Claymore blinked at this, but said nothing. Unscrewing the inkwell once more, he made some gestures with the dagger over the quill, dipped it into the inkwell full of Harry's blood, and set it on the now-unrolled parchment.

It began to draw quite rapidly, and after a few minutes, Harry could see a family tree. When it finished, Claymore waved the dagger over the inkwell and quill and the blood vanished. He placed everything but the parchment back in the drawer and gestured Harry closer.

"Well now, let's see... Hmm. No real surprises here... Oh! Seems you're in the line of succession for the House of Black. Well, no bearing on anything for today. One moment, I'll have a clerk bring the most recent statements."

Claymore knocked on a bronze pipe which was sticking out of the wall, then yelled something into it in Gobbledegook. Thanks to the Primer on Goblins Harry had read in Elysium that morning, she found that she understood most of it. It seemed that Lockjaw was Claymore's apprentice, and had been sent to Records for the requested statements. *Huh,* she thought to herself. *Hadn't realized I'd picked up Gobbledegook. Wonder what else I don't know that I know?*

Lockjaw entered the room a few minutes later, handed over a folder, and left again.

The rest of the folder was fine-print regarding the farm and business, but what caught Harry's attention (aside from the sheer amount) was that note about personal effects. *Perhaps something of my parents'?* Catching Claymore's attention, she asked, "Claymore, a couple of things have caught my attention. First, the portkey to the property at Red Wharf. Am I able to request use of that now, or do I need to wait until I come of age?"

"Well, I don't suppose there's any harm in you going to look at the place," he replied, "but ownership doesn't transfer to you until you come of age. Still, might be a good idea to be able to plan for it."

"Thank you, Claymore. I'd like to schedule that for tomorrow, then. And second," she continued, "do I have access to the storage vault yet, or only the trust vault? I'd like to examine the personal effects."

"You are indeed able to access that vault. I gather you'd like to do so today?"

"Once we're finished here, please. One last thing - I note that there is a significant amount of liquid assets in the main vault which are not being put to work. Is there anything we can do about that right now?"

"Very astute for one so young," Claymore nodded in approval. "Unfortunately, as far as the law is concerned, investment counts as withdrawal, so until you reach your majority neither you nor your guardians can do anything with it. Pity. That was mostly old Fleamont's proceeds from selling off his potions company when he retired. James, your father, never had a chance to do anything with it either. That money's been sitting idle for more than 20 years by now."

"How about the trust vault? What can you do with, say, 25,000 galleons? Something with aggressive earning potential, I'd hope. At, oh, 40% commission? That should leave enough interest income for discretionary spending, too."

"Now you're speaking my language, lad!" Claymore laughed. "Any particulars, or shall I use my best judgement?"

"I think we understand each other, Claymore. You'd know better than I what opportunities there are at present."

"I can think of a few, lad," Claymore said. "Magical only, or muggle as well?"

"Either or both, I should think," Harry said. "Which reminds me, I'll need to withdraw from my trust vault, and change a fair bit to pounds, at some point today."

"Aye, we'll get Lockjaw to take care of you, lad. Anything else?"

"No sir. Thank you for all your help today. May your enemies cower before you and your coffers never empty."

"Same to you, lad, same to you. Lockjaw!"



+++++



Lockjaw took Harry and Dobby much further down on the minecart than she'd been before. By the time they stopped, she could see the end of the tracks in the distance.

"Vault fifteen, Potter Storage Vault," Lockjaw announced. He hopped out of the cart, Harry and Dobby following, and stroked one long finger down the door. The door opened with a puff of green smoke, and the two entered. Lockjaw stayed at the entrance, unfolding a comfortable chair from seemingly nowhere and relaxing into it.

The vault looked like the back room of an antique shop. Furniture was stacked in one corner, bookshelves filled with books in another. Racks of portraits were next to a stack of trunks and several cabinets and credenzas. Rugs and tapestries lay rolled in piles along one wall. Each item had a small parchment tag attached. Next to the door was a roll of parchment with a list of tag designators matched to descriptions of the tagged items.

Dobby snagged the list and the two went over it for a bit, deciding what to focus on. While the folder Claymore had given them listed *what* was in the vault, there was so much that actually finding anything in particular took some doing.

The first thing Harry examined were the trunks. Most of them were the standard Hogwarts 'Firstie' trunk, but there were a few with substantial enhancements. A couple were even listed as "residential" trunks, which, when Harry opened them, turned out to contain an entire house's-worth of rooms inside. 

"Dobby, come look at this and tell me what you think," Harry called. She'd found that one of the residential trunks was made of *lignum vitae* of all things, which, according to the primer on Enchanting she'd devoured this morning, meant it could handle a much larger amount of magic without overloading. It also seemed to have a rather sizable rune schema locus, though she couldn't find the stone that should have been inside. With no rune schema, the interior of the trunk defaulted to a 10ft^3^ room, containing only the locus pedestal and the ladder out.

"D'you think," she continued, "that a trunk like this could handle a dueling chamber without burning out?"

Dobby squinted at it, then climbed down to examine the locus pedestal more closely. Climbing back out, he nodded. "A smallish one. Enough for three, maybe four people casting at once. More would be too much for the thaumic bleed-off rate."

"And maybe a smallish apartment, and a workshop, along with?"

"Oh, easily, Harry! Capacity is no problem with this trunk."

Harry nodded. "I guess we're taking it with us today, then! We'll have to pick up a new control stone before we leave the Alley. Now, what about some of this furniture?"

In the end, they'd managed to find enough furniture to outfit a small two-bedroom apartment; a pensieve; journals from James, Lily, and both of James' parents; several volumes of Potter Family grimoires; Lily's old textbooks, along with her reference library; some House Potter elf uniforms (one of which Dobby promptly exchanged for his current garb); and several articles of clothing that looked to be close enough in size for Harry to shift herself into a perfect fit without it being obvious. The dragon-hide boots and matching jackets (a set each of Ukrainian Ironbelly and Hebridean Black) were a particularly nice find, and even had resizing charms worked into them. Harry decided to change out of Dudley's cast-offs before they continued their errands, and ducked into the trunk.

She emerged wearing close-fitting jeans, a black v-neck t-shirt, and the Ironbelly boots and jacket. She'd also shifted her hair into a rakish mop, making the usual messy bird's nest look intentional. In all, she felt comfortably androgynous. It wasn't quite as feminine as she'd've liked, but she felt far better than before.

"What do you think, Dobby?" She asked, spinning around.

"Very nice!" Dobby exclaimed.

*Now what was next on the list?* She thought. Dropping into Elysium for a second, she recalled the list in the binder. There was something new on the list, though upon reflection she'd already known about it.

> To Do
>
> - [x] Take the Knight Bus to Gringotts ASAP and get a full accounting
> - [ ] Outfit the trunk as a proper living and training space (inc. foodstuffs and utensils)
>
> - [ ] Establish a training regimen (see Appendix A)

The trunk had a few convenience enchantments which were standard for most high-end magical luggage -- Self-shrinking, featherlight, and so forth. As such, once they'd gathered everything they wanted to bring from the vault during this trip, Harry shrank the trunk and slipped it into a pocket.

"Thank you for indulging us, Lockjaw," Harry said as they exited the vault.

They proceeded to Harry's trust vault, where Harry gathered a stack of 1,500 galleons with Dobby's help. Once back at the main floor, they bade Lockjaw farewell and stood in line to change half of the galleons to pound notes.

Back in Diagon Alley proper, it was time to find a replacement rune schema stone for the trunk. Harry and Dobby wandered down the main thoroughfare of Diagon Alley, chattering to each other about the shops they passed. In a luggage shop, Harry bought them both charmed bookbags which had an Undetectable Extension charm on them, as well as featherlight and durability charms. The proprietor also directed them to a shop up the Alley past Gringotts, where Harry picked up a variety of blank schema stones and a high-end rune-carving kit. Stopping in at an apothecary, Harry purchased a stock of medical potions, expecting to need them after the intense training she was planning. She also picked up a stock of nutrient potions to help make up for her years of malnutrition, and enough ingredients to stock a potions lab.

Finally, finished with the magical shopping, they decided to head into the Muggle world. Stepping out of the Leaky Cauldron, but still within the pub's wards, Harry shifted into proper girl-form, with longer auburn hair. She looked around for Dobby, and found instead a boy who could've been her twin brother. He had hair the same auburn as hers, though cut in a shorter, more boyish style. He was even wearing a similar outfit.

"Wha- Dobby? Is that you?" Harry yelped.

"We're in the muggle world now," Dobby replied. "House-elves mustn't be seen by muggles. I borrowed your shifting magic through the house-elf bond. Does Dobby -- er, *do I* look OK?"

"You look *brilliant,* Dobby! You could be my brother, like that! Well, we *are* family now," Harry answered. "Although, 'Dobby' is kind of an odd name for a muggle. Maybe I should call you something else? How do you feel about 'Robbie?'"

"Could... could you call me that anyway?" Robbie asked. "I'm a proud Potter elf now, and I need a name to fit."

"Robbie it is, then!" Harry said. "Hmm. I suppose I can't really answer to 'Harry' like this, either. Can't wait to be rid of that name for good, but for now..." She sighed, leaning against the wall of the pub. "Wish there was some clue from Elysium."

"Elysiu- oh, your mindscape?" Robbie asked.

"Yeah, there's all kinds of ideas kicking around in there," she replied absently. "Wait, that's it! 'Elysia!' Robbie, you're a genius!" She spun him around in a hug. "Just call me 'Ellie' for short!"

And so Ellie and Robbie set off down Charing Cross Road.


+++++


After a quick stop for lunch, the two wandered the shops for the rest of the afternoon. Elysia managed to find a full set of free-weights and some gym mats, as well as both a heavy bag and a speed-bag. Gloves were a non-issue as she could simply shift them into place as needed.

They also found more clothes. Both Elysia and Robbie were reveling in the ability to wear what they wanted for once. Robbie, in particular, had a *penchánt* for socks with loud patterns, while Elysia enjoyed more form-fitting apparel after being saddled with horribly-oversized cast-offs all her life.

It also turned out that, thanks to her shifting ability, she no longer needed glasses. (She shifted away her scar, too, because _good riddance._) Since the world expected Harry Potter to wear them, though, she figured she might as well get some nice ones, and perhaps add enchantments at some point. She picked out some sunglasses with a classic look, and as they browsed at other stores, idly scratched runes in them with a fingernail shifted to a steel-hard point. She got as far as runes to darken automatically in bright sunlight, and turn clear in the shade, before they were done shopping.

Lastly, they picked up kitchenware and several appliances, bedding, curtains, and the rest of the little things that make a house feel more like a home. And after a final stop at a grocer to stock their larders, Robbie popped them both back to Elysia's room at #4 Privet Drive.

Robbie, having returned to his natural elf form, began moving the perishable goods into some of the stasis cupboards they'd found in the vault. Meanwhile, Elysia dug out one of the new schema stones and the carving kit, and sat down at the dilapidated old desk under the window to start laying out the new configuration for the trunk.

It was late into the night before she was finished. Hedwig had returned from hunting all day and was snoozing, head tucked under one wing, on the perch near the window, by the time Elysia sat back and called Robbie over.

"What do you think, are we ready to pop this in?" She asked, gesturing to the schema stone.

He leaned over it, muttering quietly under his breath, and then nodded. "I don't see any problems. I've gone over the trunk, and it's charged and ready."

"Thanks, Robbie," Elysia said, standing up and stretching. Between the two of them, they managed to get the schema stone, which was roughly the size of the Dursley's big-screen TV, maneuvered down into the trunk and settled into place on the pedestal. The trunk's interior, which had started as an empty 10ft^3^ room, shifted around them.

When everything stopped moving, they found themselves still in a 10ft^3^ room, but the ladder was gone and there was a door in its place. One of the walls was taken up with several displays, showing the status of the trunk's various wards, power levels, air and water, a view of the outside, and so on. Through the door was a spacious living room, with an elevator platform leading up out of the trunk (a button turned it into stairs and back) and an open kitchen separated by a cooktop island. A short hallway led to two bedroom suites, a spacious study with a workshop area, and a huge training room. The entire place was brightly lit by both an ambient *lumos* and large charmed bay windows throughout. It wasn't exactly a mansion, but for the two of them it was more than comfortable.

The living area was piled high with all of the spoils from the day's errands, but between the two of them they made short work of it all. In less than an hour, everything was squared away, and they fell into their beds exhausted but delighted. It was, Elysia thought to herself as she drifted off, going to be the best summer ever.

## Chapter 4: Harmony

### #4 Privet Drive, Surrey	1994/06/27	6:30

The next morning, after the usual morning ablutions and a quick breakfast of porridge, fresh fruit, and a nutrient potion, Elysia sat in the training room to meditate. After the initial grounding, centering, and contemplation of emptiness, she decided to pop into her mindscape.

"Hello!" Janet greeted her, as soon as she opened her eyes. She'd appeared back in the study. "Great work yesterday! Good use of resources, too. The bond with Dobby -- well, Robbie now, which is a very good thing -- anyway, *that* was unexpected."

Elysia raised an eyebrow. "Oh? What do you mean?"

Janet assumed a preparing-to-give-a-lecture pose. "If you recall, there is a formal oath to bind a house elf. You can think of this as the Bond of Agency, for reference. It makes the elf an agent of the House, so that it may act in service to the House. It does not make the elf a *member* of the House. When you added in the line about being part of the family, the nature of the bond changed. Instead of a Bond of Agency, it became a Bond of Brotherhood. While you both now act in the interests of House Potter -- especially as the last two members of House Potter -- there is no subservience. This is a bond of equals. As far as Magic is concerned, you two are siblings now. And thanks to the bond, you two will begin to instinctively act as siblings towards each other."

Elysia's eyes widened at that. "Woah! I have a brother!? This is so cool! I've always wanted a proper family..."

Janet smiled. "More than that, Ellie. The bond now acts more like a twin bond than a house-elf bond."

"Like the Weasley Twins?"

Janet nodded. "Just like that. A bit stronger, actually, thanks to how house-elf magic works. You can already share your subconscious knowledge library. You'll eventually be able to communicate telepathically, with enough practice, even without linking mindscapes."

"Wait, I can link mindscapes?"

Janet looked confused for a moment. "Oh, right, we weren't expecting this to come up yet. You weren't supposed to have to worry about symmetrical bonds like this until bonding with your soul-mates."

Elysia shook her head. "Wait, soul-*mates?* As in, more than one?"

"That's right," Janet replied. "You have a few potential soul-mates that you are likely to meet in this phase of your life. It's not some mystical bond in and of itself; it just means that you're extremely compatible. You'll just *get* each other more easily. That said, that compatibility lends itself to certain kinds of magical bond-oaths. The most common is the magical Marriage Vows; most magical married couples can at least sense their partner's moods through this bond, although usually by the point that's even an option they've been able to read each other's body language well enough already."

"Okay, so are you saying that that's a lower end on the abilities of a bond like that?"

Janet smiled. "Exactly! Because of how in-sync you are, there's less interference over the bond connection. That makes it more efficient, and so you can do more with that connection. Linking mindscapes is one of the more complex possibilities, as is sharing magic."

"Robbie did that with me yesterday."

"Yes, and that's a pretty common manifestation of a twin bond too. It all comes down to harmonics and thaumic resonance, really, for *any* bond. The more in-tune the ends are with each other, the better the connection."

"Okay, that's sounding like it's not limited to two people." Elysia said.

"It's not," Janet agreed. "There have been triad bonds, pack bonds, and House bonds before, for example. Obviously, the more people in the bond, the harder it is to get everyone in tune with each other, and therefore the less capable the bond becomes. Practically speaking, four is usually the upper limit for anything truly useful, though larger groups are not unheard of."

"That makes sense," Elysia said. "So, to compare this to light, or a radio, this is more about the frequency than the power?"

"Bingo!" Janet exclaimed. "Power is more a function of your individual *internal* harmony. That's why magic is so heavily intent-based. The stronger your intent, the more *unified* you are in your intent, the more powerful your magic is. It all comes down to focus and willpower. You should add the books about this to your list."

Elysia nodded. "I should just read them right now, honestly."

"I'll leave you to it, then," Janet replied, and vanished.

Elysia opened the binder on the desk.

> To Do
>
> - [ ] Find and read the primers on Math, Signal Processing, Bonds, Blood Magic, Rituals, and Soul Magic
> - [ ] Find and read the primer on Apparition
> - [ ] Establish a training regimen (see Appendix A)
> - [ ] Check out The Kiln at Red Wharf Bay

After Elysia finished off the primers, she cracked open Appendix A. She found a comprehensive training plan, covering calisthenics, free-weights, cardio, flexibility, martial arts forms, combat shifting, and magical development. There were specific exercises to build magical stamina (by casting and holding a wandless *Patronus* charm -- or several, at more advanced stages -- for longer and longer intervals), control (by wandlessly levitating more and more tennis balls while going through martial arts forms), power (the classic shooting gallery, with more and more durable targets), and finesse (more and more detailed *Image*-class illusion charms and conjurations). Each day's workout ended with stretching and a meditation session. All told, she expected it to take anywhere from an hour to the entire day, depending on what point she was at in the training cycle and how much time she wanted to spend that day.

From yesterday's reading, she knew that, while she could use shifting to augment her physical abilities, only exercise would build the base level. The stronger she got *without* shifting, the more she'd be able to do *with.*

Popping back to the real world, she got on with it. Robbie joined her, and the two even sparred for a bit. This was complicated by the bond, as not only had the knowledge and instincts been shared, but so had the combo patterns. They found themselves throwing the same moves at the same time more often than not, and Elysia made a note for them both to work on that.

Finally, after they were done training, Elysia shifted back to Harry-form and headed out into Durzkaban to borrow the phone. She'd had the idea that her friends might want to come along to check out the Red Wharf property. There wasn't enough time to send Hedwig with a letter asking Ron, nor did she have access to a floo. Hermione, on the other hand, lived in a muggle house, and had a telephone. And she'd given Elysia her number (and address) after the debacle with the bars on the window and the flying car two summers ago.

Thankfully, Dudley was still at Smeltings until July, and Vernon was at work. Petunia was out in the garden, though it was nearing noon so she'd have to be quick before her aunt came back in out of the heat.

"Granger residence," Hermione's voice said.

"Hey, Hermione," Elysia said.

"Harry! Somehow I never expected you to call. You always send Hedwig, and I suppose I've just gotten so used to the way witches and wizards do things, it's always such an adjustment being back from Hogwarts over the summers."

"Breathe, Hermione," Elysia laughed. Hermione made a little *hmph* noise as she continued. "Anyway, you doing anything today? I stopped by Gringotts yesterday to see if anything of my parents' was in storage -- after last year, I got curious about the Marauders and all that -- and it turns out there was!"

"Ooh! Like what, Harry?" Hermione asked.

"Like a lot of things," Elysia replied. "Like years' worth of journals for both of them, and the deed to some place in Wales from my grandfather. There's a portkey at Gringotts, and I was planning on taking it down this afternoon to look around. Interested in coming with? You can meet Robbie, too."

"Robbie? Who's Robbie? Harry, it's been all of a day!" Hermione said.

"If you come with, you can find out," Elysia teased.

"Okay, fine," Hermione huffed. "What time?"

"Noon or so? We can grab lunch in Charing or something, make an afternoon of it."

"Harry, it's almost noon now! How're you going to get here so quickly?"

"You'll find out. See you in a bit, Hermione."

Ending the call, Elysia made it back to her room just as she heard Aunt Petunia coming in through the back door.



+++++



### Granger House, Crawley	1994/06/27	12:01

Robbie popped the two of them to Hermione's doorstep. Elysia wasn't sure how Robbie knew where it was -- she hadn't even seen him check a map. And yet here they were.

Robbie had shifted into his human form again, and Elysia was back in the androgynous look she'd left Gringotts in yesterday. They were both dressed in the same outfits as yesterday -- jeans, t-shirts, and the dragonhide boots and jackets (Robbie had laid claim on the Hebridean Black, while Elysia preferred the Ukrainian Ironbelly). Elysia wore a plain heather-grey v-neck, but Robbie's t-shirt said "Frankie Says Relax" in big letters across the chest.

The door burst open at Elysia's knock. "Harry!" Hermione flew at her, engulfing her in a classic Hermione-hug. It struck Elysia then just how off-kilter she always felt over the summer, because all of a sudden, *she didn't.*

Hermione disengaged the hug and held Elysia at arm's length. "Harry," she said, "what happened? You look *fantastic!* It's only been a day! How have you changed so much in only a day? And who is this?" She asked, turning to Robbie.

Elysia smiled. "Hullo, 'Mione. This is Robbie. My brother."

Hermione gasped. "Your what? Harry, I thought all your family was *dead!* Aside from those dreadful Dursleys, of course."

"It's a long story," Elysia said. "What say I fill you in over lunch? Robbie and I found this little sushi joint 'round the corner from the Leaky."



+++++



"So because you changed the words of the bond oath, you and Robbie have a twin bond now?" Hermione asked, nibbling on a piece of pickled ginger.

"Pretty much," Elysia said. She and Robbie had filled Hermione in over several rolls of sushi. It was a good thing Robbie had put privacy and notice-me-not palings on their table after their food arrived, because Hermione simply could not contain herself. Her eyes got bigger and bigger as Elysia went on, and at several points she couldn't help but exclaim out loud.

"And you have memory-constructs of your parents in your mindscape?" She went on. 

Elysia nodded.

"And a library in your head full of *more knowledge than Hogwarts!?*" Hermione exclaimed. 

Elysia nodded again.

"And on top of that you're set for life, money-wise," Hermione continued. "Are there any *other* Earth-shattering revelations you need to tell me?"

Elysia took a deep breath. "Just one more. Hermione, I'm a girl."

Hermione's brow furrowed. "What? Harry, what do you mean?"

"It's Elysia now, or Ellie for short, not Harry. At least, not when I don't have to be." She shifted into girl-form, letting her hair lengthen but keeping it her usual black. She swept her glasses off and leaned intently across the table towards Hermione. "You're the *only* person who knows so far, besides Robbie. I haven't even told Ron yet."

"Merlin," Hermione stammered. *Wow she's pretty,* she caught herself thinking.

Elysia shifted back, replacing her glasses. "Hermione? Please say something?" She said hesitantly.

"I... wow. Somehow, it makes sense," Hermione said. "So, are you, what's the word... transgender?"

Elysia shrugged. "I guess? Is that the word for not knowing you're a girl at first?"

"Pretty much," Hermione said. "I bet being able to shapeshift like that helps a lot, huh?"

"Like you wouldn't believe."



+++++



### The Kiln, Red Wharf Bay, Wales, UK	1994/06/27	13:02

After activating the portkey at Gringotts, the three of them appeared in an unpaved lane across from a fenced plot of land. A branch of the lane led into the property, with an arched gate proclaiming this place to be 'The Kiln.' In the distance, they could see a building of some sort.

Elysia immediately shifted back to girl-shape, and Robbie back to elf-shape. "Ah, much better," they both said, then looked at each other and burst out laughing. 

Hermione just gave them a look, though Elysia noticed her lips twitching.

They eventually made it to the end of the drive, to find that there were actually several buildings. One was a barn, painted a weathered red. Another was what looked like a distillery, with various faucets and fittings sticking from the walls. A third was a nondescript wooden building that nevertheless fairly shone when Elysia looked at it under mage-sight (which she'd learned from yesterday's primers).

The final building was a cozy-looking one-story farmhouse. It too shone under mage-sight, though not as brightly as the other building. In fact, that building reminded Elysia of something...

"Hey, you lot, I think that building's like the trunk," Elysia said to the others.

"Ooh!" Hermione squealed, and darted over to it.

The other two joined her as she tugged open the door. Inside, visible through the daylight streaming in behind them, was a schema stone pedestal nearly identical to the one in Elysia's residential trunk.

Elysia cast a few wandless *lumos* orbs as Hermione dashed over to take a closer look. Robbie started examining the walls, and Elysia sent a few more orbs his way before joining Hermione.

"Thanks, Ellie," he murmured absently.

"Sure, bro," she replied, just as absently.

"Merlin's beard, you really weren't kidding about that bond," Hermione said.

"Huh?"

"Ellie, you just called Robbie 'bro.'"

"... I did? Huh. You OK with that, Robbie?" She called.

"Sure, Ellie. Hey, I think the schema stone overloaded," He replied.

Elysia squinted at the pedestal. "You know, I think you're right. There're blast marks on the pedestal, and some rock dust."

Robbie nodded. "There's bits of rock all over the floor, too, and some of these traces are burned out. A *lot* of them, actually."

"I wonder what happened?" Hermione murmured.

"Dunno," Elysia shrugged. "One of Grandpa Fleamont's experiments, I suppose. Or Grandma Euphemia's, more likely."

"Ellie," Hermione said, stifling a giggle, "your grandfather's name is *Fleamont?*"



+++++



After that, the actual farmhouse was disconcertingly normal. The front door opened into a greatroom, with a spacious kitchen area on one side, a dining area with a heavily-scuffed round eight-seat table, a couple of beat-up leather sofas and a matching armchair, and a large, floo-size hearth. A hallway led to four bedrooms, two bathrooms, and the master suite. The whole place was very cozy, but also absolutely *covered* in decades' worth of dust. And aside from the table, sofas, and armchair, completely empty -- no beds, no dressers or wardrobes, not even a desk. No personal effects, either. They made a quick circuit through the place and darted back outside, sneezing the whole way.

Robbie and Elysia looked at each other once the sneezes stopped. 

"Aerial survey?" 

"Uh-huh."

Elysia turned to Hermione. "Wanna come along?"

"What do you mean?" Hermione asked nervously. "You're not going to make me ride a broom, are you?"

Elysia winked at her and shifted into a hippogriff. 



+++++



Although she managed to keep from squeezing her eyes shut, Hermione maintained a death-grip on Elysia's neck regardless of the wandless sticking charm on her jeans as the girls and Robbie, also shifted to hippogriff, flew around the property.

Most of the land was sectioned off for crops, though the fields had obviously lain fallow for a long time. One corner of the property was woodland, bordered on one side by a crystal-clear pond. In the middle of the property, though, hidden behind the cottage, was a rusted and overgrown quidditch pitch and a ramshackle broom-shed.

"Ron would love this!" Hermione yelled over the rushing air.

Elysia could only chirp in agreement.

They landed back in front of the pedestal building.

"Don't tell Ron you got me to ride you," Hermione said, with a bashful grin. "His head might explode."

Elysia flushed deep red, gaping. "I. Um. I think *my* head might explode."

Robbie laughed so hard he fell over.

## Chapter 5: Was This A Date?

The next day, Elysia noticed an addition to her to-do list. 

> To Do
>
> - [x] Find and read Divination And Privacy: Information Control In The Magical World
> - [ ] Examine the blood wards Dumbledore claims to have put on #4 Privet Drive

*Wait, blood wards? Is* that *why Dumbledore keeps sending me back here?*

After reading the primer and finishing their morning workout, she and Robbie started poking around the Dursley home for wards, and potential anchors. Pushing her magic into her eyes, she activated what ward-crafters and curse-breakers called Mage-Sight, allowing her to see visual representations of magical manifestations which would otherwise be invisible -- such as ward-lines, which in this case glowed a deep, pulsing blood-red. They followed the ward traces to a flag-stone in the back garden, one of the path leading to the tool-shed.

Flipping it over, they found a relatively straightforward ward schema and a smear of red. She checked the adjacent stones, too, just in case, but they were blank. *Hmm, possibilities,* she thought.

Between the two of them, they were able to decode the ward schema. It was, in Elysia's divinely-expert opinion, amateurish at best. "Mage-repelling -- inverted muggle-repelling, really -- with a whitelist, some ties to what I'm assuming is my blood there... a life-monitor, remote notifier link, ooh, *nasty* anti-Dark Mark ward... an arithmantic descriptor array -- for the blood protection thing, looks like..."

"Are those *emotion-amplifiers?*" Robbie gasped incredulously.

"What the -- they *are!* And linked to the familial descriptor array, as if it's meant to amplify familial bonds, but... I'm not in that array. And it amplifies *all* emotions, not just positive ones. And that's only linked as 'targets,' not with any specifics... Oh, that's just *sloppy!*"

"That explains why the Dursleys are such caricatures of normality, I suppose," Robbie said.

A cold tingle crawled across Elysia's scalp, and she replaced the ward stone. "I get the feeling we should leave this alone for now," she told Robbie. "Could be useful as evidence or something later."



+++++



The summer fell into a rhythm fairly quickly. Elysia had gotten into good enough shape that she'd been able to read the primers for more hard-style martial arts, like jiu jitsu, krav maga, and Shaolin animal-style kung fu. She'd moved on to 'Elysia's Combat Style: Stage 2,' which touched heavily on Jeet Kun Do. Mornings were spent training with Robbie, and afternoons were spent on everything else: reading her family's journals, writing to friends, fiddling around with projects, finishing up summer homework, and frequently meeting up with Hermione. After coming out to her, Elysia no longer felt the need to shift into her 'Harry' shape around Hermione, and they both got used to Elysia's girl-ness surprisingly quickly.

Elysia found that she really enjoyed enchanting. She spent quite a bit of time making some enhancements to her new glasses, such as adding night-vision, false-color thermal, x-ray vision, zoom, Mage Sight augmentation, and a thaumic analytics HUD -- she was particularly pleased with this project, as all of these enhancements were etched on a separate schema stone she'd shrunk down and wore as a pendant, and then tied into the glasses. This gave her lots of room to add features later, too.

She and Robbie took advantage of the other flagstones to add to the wards -- aside from a self-erase on the newly-added wardstone (set to trigger either whenever the original stone was flipped, or via long-distance triggering charm), they also added Trace shielding -- which was probably illegal for a muggle house, but then again so were blood wards. And both Elysia and Robbie felt that, since pure-blood children could practice magic all they liked without consequence outside of school, the law was a farce in the first place. Still, coupling it with a notice-me-not/*confundus* hybrid ward was downright inspired, Elysia thought. That particular combination, one of Robbie's ideas, would make any visible spells register to muggles as just Dudley mucking around with fireworks or, if inside, something on the telly.

Hermione had expressed (vocally and at great length) the desire to learn some of what Elysia could now do, so Elysia began teaching her the basics of both mind magic and free-form wandless casting. As part of these, she and Robbie also started teaching Hermione some martial arts, particularly tai chi as it lent itself well to spell-channeling.

They still made time to have fun, though. It was a good summer for cinema. Neither Elysia nor Robbie had ever been before, so Hermione had taken them both to see *The Lion King,* *Baby's Day Out,* *Little Rascals,* *Forrest Gump,* and *The Mask* (which Robbie particularly enjoyed).

Robbie had wanted to examine the pedestal building at The Kiln again (and give the two friends some time without Elysia's 'brother' tagging along, he confided to her), so Elysia and Hermione saw *Black Beauty* just the two of them.

*Why does this feel like a date?* They both thought, walking out of the theater. Not that either of them had ever actually been on a date, but their hands had kept brushing while they were sharing a tub of popcorn, and neither girl was sure if it had been entirely accidental or not.

By now, Robbie and Elysia's bond had progressed to the point that they could, with effort, send messages to each other telepathically. So when Hermione asked if Elysia would stay for dinner, she let Robbie know and barely avoided blushing visibly at the smirk he sent back.

"Ugh, brothers," she grumbled good-naturedly to Hermione, as they walked through Crawley back to the Granger residence.

"What about Robbie now?" Hermione asked.

"Just teasing me a bit, is all," Elysia said. "It's amazing to see how much more self-assured he is compared to two years ago, or even the beginning of summer hols."

"You too, Ellie. Is that the bond's doing, do you think, or just different circumstances?"

"A bit of both, I suppose. Anyone'd do better away from the Malfoys or Durzkaban. But the bond probably has a pretty big effect. I know my work ethic's increased, too, probably as a side-effect. Did I tell you I wrote McGonagall? She's letting me drop Divination if I can test into Arithmancy. Which I can. I could test *out* of Arithmancy if I read far enough in my mindscape library, but if I do that for classes I'm actually taking, school will be *so boring.* As it is, I do have the math down, just not the applications."

"And also, this way we share a class just the two of us," Hermione smiled.

"That too, yeah." Elysia smiled back. They both blushed and looked away.

"*Ahem.* So, the bond," Hermione said quickly. "How exactly does that impact your and Robbie's personalities so much?"

"There's a few things that go into it, really. Do they go over the waveform model of magic in third-year Arithmancy?"

"The what?"

Elysia sighed. "Okay, this is going to be more complicated than I'd thought. Let's see, analogies... D'you know how light and radio and magnetism and all that can be thought of as waves? Well, magic is like that too."

Hermione looked startled, then got a thoughtful expression on her face. "Go on."

"The other thing you need to know is that magic comes from the soul, more-or-less. Power comes from internal harmony of intent. The stronger, more unified, more *in sync,* I guess, your intent is, the more powerful the magic is as a direct result."

"More focused, maybe?" Hermione queried. "Like a laser?"

"Exactly!" Elysia exclaimed. "Magic's all about focus and willpower. Past a certain threshold, it starts to self-reinforce. A bond is a magical connection, and so works similarly. And since the parameters of the bond are defined by the oath, it tends to reinforce things related to the oath. The Waveform model makes a whole lot of things about magic make more sense, really, even if it *is* just an abstraction and not totally accurate. ...What?" She asked, warily, as Hermione was staring at her with a funny look on her face.

"I like this new you," Hermione said. "I always knew you were smart, but it's *wonderful* to be able to have conversations like this with you. Before this summer, most of our conversations were taken up with homework, quidditch, or whatever crisis of the moment. Now... you just seem more comfortable in your own skin. More confident, more driven. More playful, too. Happier. I don't know, maybe that's just growing up. But I don't think it's *only* that."

Elysia was silent for a little while, thinking. She hadn't thought about it much after the first couple of days, but she really had changed a *lot* over the summer. Her birthday had been a few weeks ago, her first as Elysia, and all of the cards and such were addressed to 'Harry' except Hermione's. Her Hogwarts letter, which had also arrived that day, was the same. It was jarring to think that that name still referred to her, and by necessity would continue to until she could change it upon reaching her majority.

She still hadn't told Ron about most of it, either. Not that she was a girl, nor that she was a shape-shifter, nor the past-life knowledge. She'd mentioned Robbie, and some of the things from the vault (though not the money or the trunk), but not The Kiln or all the time she was spending with Hermione. And none of that had occurred to her *at all* until just now. It struck her all at once that she was growing apart from her first friend, and she *really* didn't know how to feel about that.

"Merlin and Morgana, I really *have* changed," she breathed. "Hermione, I've not told Ron about hardly *any* of this!"

"I can just see his eyes glazing over if you did, though," Hermione replied.

"No, I mean hardly *anything* about this summer. I haven't even told him I'm a girl!"

Hermione stopped dead in her tracks.

"Or the past-life knowledge, or the shifting, or even the trunk!" Elysia continued, before noticing that Hermione wasn't beside her anymore. "Um, Hermione?"

"Oh no, I forgot you're famous! And I know how much you hate all of that, but Ellie, you *know* people are going to make a fuss about anything you do. And how do magicals even think about trans people, anyway? Is it even an issue? So much else is pre-Victorian, so maybe not, but..."

Elysia couldn't help but smile. "Breathe, Hermione. I got through that Heir of Slytherin hogwash, didn't I?"

Hermione took a deep breath, and smiled sheepishly. "You're right, it's not quite life-or-death, is it?"

"I don't suppose so," Elysia said. "Still, it's something I should have at least given *some* thought before now. I guess I just felt that if *you* were okay with it all, the rest didn't really matter."

Hermione smiled bashfully. "I'm flattered."

"I don't suppose that's really fair to Ron, though, is it?" Elysia continued.

"Well, maybe not, but he *is* a bloke," Hermione said. "And Ron can be a particularly *insensitive* bloke sometimes."

"That's true. Oh, that reminds me. I wanted to apologize for being such a git over that Firebolt last Christmas. You were only looking out for me, like you always do. You deserve better than my throwing a tantrum over it. And anyway, you were right," she grinned, "it *was* sent by Sirius."

"Of course I was right. I'm *always* right," Hermione said with mock solemnity.

"We'll have to make that the Hogwarts Mantra," Elysia said. "'Hermione is always right. I will listen to Hermione. I will not ignore Hermione's recommendations. Hermione is God. If this ever happens again, Hermione will personally rip your lungs out.'"

Hermione stuck her tongue out, then giggled. "I didn't know you'd seen Babylon 5!"

"I haven't, not really. Just heard a bit here and there when Dudley had the telly up too loud. That bit stuck because I thought it was hilarious."

"It objectively is, though! The entire show is quotable like that. Maybe it'll be out on tape someday and we can watch it together. I wonder..."

"Are you thinking about how to get a VHS and a telly to work inside Hogwarts too?"

Hermione smirked. "Maybe..."

By this time, they'd made it back to the Granger residence. They were just about to enter when Hermione suddenly spun around and hugged Elysia tightly.

"Um, 'Mione?" Elysia asked as the other witch let go. "What was that for?"

"Do I need a reason to hug my best friend?" She replied. "Besides, are you really objecting?"

"Never," Elysia stated firmly. "You couldn't *Imperius* me to object to one of your hugs."

Smiling brightly, Hermione led the way inside.



### Granger House, Crawley	1994/08/20	17:36

Elysia was nervous. Since they both worked, she'd only met Hermione's parents, Emerson and Danika ("call me Dani, everyone does"), a couple of times before, and never had a chance for much in the way of conversation with them. And now she was staring down the barrel of not only an entire meal's worth of such, but also coming out to them.

*Breathe,* she told herself. *Hermione's right here. She's got your back. She always does.*

Hermione's parents were just finishing up in the kitchen. "Hey, kids," her mother called. "You're just in time."

They all sat around the dinner table as Emerson brought in the main course, a pot roast.

"So," he said as he took his seat. "You're the mysterious Elysia we've been hearing so much about this summer."

"It's so lovely to see Hermione having a friend to do things with in the summer," Dani gushed. "How did you two meet, anyway?"

"Um, we met on the train to Hogwarts back in first year," Elysia said hesitantly.

"Oh? Odd that she's never mentioned you before now," Dani said.

"Only ever those two boys, Ron and Harry," Emerson said. "Mostly Harry, really," he added with a smirk at his daughter.

Elysia gave Hermione a look, one eyebrow raised high. Hermione bit her lip and busied herself with her food, refusing to meet Elysia's eyes.

"Why Hermione, I didn't know you cared," she teased. Turning back to the Drs. Granger, she said, "As it happens, she *has* mentioned me. I'm Harry. Or, I was, I suppose. I'm transgender. Didn't click that I was a girl 'til after all the fuss up at school was over for the year, but then once I twigged to it, things moved pretty fast."

The Granger parents seemed shocked, but not, Elysia hoped, in a bad way.

"It turns out I have latent shape-shifting abilities," she continued. "Found my parents' journals, put a few things together, and, well..." She shifted into Harry-shape and waved shyly at them before shifting back.

"My goodness!" Dani gasped. 

"Well. This is a lot to take in," Emerson said. "But I thought you kids weren't allowed to use magic outside of school?"

"We're not allowed to use *wands* outside of school, sir, aside from in an emergency," Elysia replied. "There are plenty of other ways to use magic -- such as runes, potions, wandless casting, and innate abilities like my shape-shifting."

"How fascinating! Could you possibly show us some of that? We've never had a chance to see what Hermione's been learning up at school because of that law," Dani said.

Elysia was nonplussed. "You're really okay with me being a girl? Just like that?"

"You *do* seem much happier than last we saw you, hon, and that's the important thing," Dani replied.

Elysia smiled in relief. Hermione patted her arm, and said, "Well, after we eat, how about we show you what Ellie's been teaching me this summer?"



+++++



After dinner, they all moved into the living room, where Hermione showed off some wandless magic, Elysia turned into various animals, and the two of them demonstrated a magically-augmented round of a tai chi exercise called Push Hands. Just as they finished, Hedwig and a tiny little ball of energy (that may or may not have been an owl) flew in with letters from Ron for the two girls.

> Harry,
>
> Dad's managed to get tickets to the Quidditch World Cup final, and Top Box at that! Someone at work owed him a favor, so we're all going ('cept Mum), and there's tickets for you and Hermione too. He even made sure there was room for Robbie, though since he's a house-elf he won't need a ticket.
>
> Anyway, the match is the day after tomorrow, and Mum says you and Hermione can stay with us for the rest of Break. 
>
> Dad said he can pick you up from the Dursleys, but it might be easier if Robbie could bring you. You know how Dad gets.
>
> See you soon!

>
> ​    - Ron

Elysia and Hermione looked at each other.

"You're not going to subject Mr. Weasley and the Dursleys to each other, are you, Ellie?" Hermione asked.

"Merlin, no! Mr. Weasley's a sweet man, but he's a bit... *something* when it comes to Muggle things," Elysia responded. "Uncle Vernon would have a stroke. Robbie?"

Robbie popped into the Grangers' living room. "You rang, Ellie?"

"Hey, bro. Robbie, these are Hermione's parents." Elysia said, making introductions. "Anyway, Ron's invited us -- you, me, and Hermione -- to stay for the rest of summer, and to join them at the Quidditch World Cup final. Top Box, even. Mr. Weasley offered to pick us up, but..."

Robbie snorted. "But the Dursleys. No worries, I'll just pop us over and save everyone the trouble. Noon-ish?"

"Works for me. Hermione? Drs. Granger?"

Hermione turned honest-to-Morgana *puppy eyes* on her parents. "Please, Mum and Dad?"

Hermione's parents looked at each other and laughed. "Goodness, Hermione, I thought you didn't like quidditch if Har - er, Elysia wasn't playing," Dani teased.

Hermione blushed bright enough to show clearly through her caramel complexion. "But, Mum, it's an international event! Think of the cultural experience!"

Elysia and Emerson shared a grin. "Never change, Hermione," Elysia said fondly.



+++++



That night, Elysia popped into her mindscape to speak with the memory-constructs of her parents. At the same time, Hermione sought out her own parents.

"Mum, Dad, can I talk to you?"

"Of course, sweetie, what is it?"

"... I think I'm starting to fall for my best friend."



## Chapter 6: To The Burrow

### #4 Privet Drive, Little Whinging, Surrey	1994/08/21	11:55

The next morning, Elysia wrote to her godfather, Sirius Black. While they'd exchanged a couple of letters over the summer, she'd told him even less than she had Ron thus far. She'd thought about it, sure, but so much had happened that she didn't even know where to start. She finally wrote about the Quidditch World Cup and that she and Hermione could be reached care of the Weasleys for the rest of the summer, and sent Hedwig on her way.

That done, she decided to pop into Elysium and check in with Janet. As she appeared in the study, Janet walked in from the hallway. "Oh good, you're here. There are some important things you need to know before you return to the magical world."

Elysia got comfortable in one of the chairs as Janet assumed her lecturing stance. "First, Albus Dumbledore is not your friend. He's manipulated you since before you were even born."

Elysia gasped, whether in shock our outrage she wasn't sure.

"There was a prophecy made about you and Voldemort," Janet continued. "A fake one, I might add -- and he's taken it to mean that you need to sacrifice yourself in order for Voldemort to finally be defeated for good. So he manipulated events to, first, bring the child of the prophecy to light -- it could have been either you or Neville Longbottom -- and then, once it was clear (to him, anyway) that the prophecy referred to you, he had you raised in such a way that you'd be willing to sacrifice yourself to defeat Voldemort without a second thought. He's desperate, not necessarily malicious, but he's also been drinking his own Kool-Aid, and he's developed a severe case of tunnel vision where you and Voldemort are concerned."

"But... *why?* Why does he think that I have to die?"

"Because of the piece of Voldemort's soul that was in your scar, that anchors him to this world. He can't die while they still exist. He's made several, through the darkest of magic, but the one in your scar was unintentional and he never even knew about it. We'll get back to the others, but the one on your scar was removed before you were sent back."

"But Dumbledore doesn't know that, right?"

"Exactly, so he'll still try and manipulate you to his own ends. In your last life, he even resorted to potions after this year to prevent any attachments strong enough to give you the desire to live instead of sacrificing yourself. You've changed enough already that he might do that sooner, so you need to know how to counteract them. And teach Hermione too; she's close enough to you that she's a target for him as well. And one other, but you haven't met her yet."

"Not Ron?" Elysia asked.

"No, not Ron," Janet confirmed. "The entire Weasley family has unquestioning faith in Dumbledore. Even if they knew about his meddling, they'd think it for the best, and go along with it without a second thought."

"So, what, should I just walk away from the whole family because they're too trusting? From my first friend?"

"No, of course not," Janet said. "Just don't expect them to pick you over the Headmaster if it comes to that. He's infallible to them, despite all evidence to the contrary. People believe what they want to believe, and magicals are even more prone to this sort of thinking, culturally speaking."

"I should probably act like as little has changed as possible, then," Elysia mused. "Show too much independence and it sounds like he'll start getting heavy-handed."

"Most likely," Janet confirmed. "He *is* the one who went against your parents' wills and had you placed with the Dursleys. Left you, a toddler who could already climb, on the doorstep in a basket, in *November,* no less. You could have frozen, or wandered into traffic. And he sealed the wills so nobody would find out. Also, he's the one who cast the *Fidelius* charm to hide your parents. He *knew* Sirius was innocent."

"What!?" Elysia shrieked.

"He'd claim Sirius' incarceration was a 'necessary evil' to keep you safely hidden under impenetrable blood-wards tied to your mother's sacrifice. He's not a malicious man, Elysia. He has good intentions. But as the saying goes, the road to Hell is paved with those, and Dumbledore is rather far down his own personal highway."

"Lovely. So what's this about soul pieces, then?" Elysia asked, changing the subject. She was feeling horribly betrayed, and didn't want to deal with it yet.

"They're called horcruxes," Janet said. "Voldemort made six intentionally. You already destroyed one, the diary in your second year."

"Merlin! And there are *five more* of those things lying around?" Elysia exclaimed. "Glad I got to enjoy this summer, because it sounds like it was the last carefree one I'm going to get for awhile."

"That's why you insisted we give you this one," Janet agreed. "Anyway, The List has an appendix on the details of the horcruxes. You won't be able to do much about most of them yet, but The List will update when you can."

Elysia threw herself backwards into the chair. "No pressure, then," she said morosely.

Janet smiled sadly. "I know it's a lot. And it's only the tip of the iceberg, though the rest isn't as urgent."

Elysia cocked an eyebrow. "Now what?"

"Magical society is stagnating," Janet replied, "in large part because of Dumbledore's policies -- and Magic is dying because of it. And _you,_" she continued, "are the one Destiny has chosen to fix it -- _by any means necessary._ If you have to become a tyrant and drag the entire magical world kicking and screaming into the 21st century through a sea of blood, then that's what it takes. Destiny's given you a blank check on the other side. Though obviously, if you can avoid the sea of blood and such, that'd be preferable."

"I'm sure," Elysia said faintly, eyes wide.

"You don't have to worry about that part yet," Janet reassured her. "Just focus on Voldemort for now. The thing about death by stagnation is that it takes awhile. You've got time."

"Why me?" Elysia moaned, face in her hands.

"You asked Destiny that yourself, before coming back," Janet said. "You're a pivot point in the time-stream, and so are ideally-placed to change things."

"Oh. Wait a minute, Destiny's a _person?_"

"Yup!" Janet replied. "Well, _personification,_ really. And Eleanor is right -- Destiny really does rock the Little Black Dress. Reminds me of Posh Spice a bit, actually."

"Who?"

"Oh, right. Give it a couple of years. You'll find out."

Elysia sighed. "You just like bewildering me, don't you?"

"Confusion means your brain is learning!" Janet sang.

"Oh, and one more thing," she added. "There's going to be a bit of a Death Eater reunion the night of the match. Someone will cast the Dark Mark which will cause them all to apparate away. Plan accordingly."

+++++



There being nothing to pack, what with all her and Robbie's worldly possessions fitting handily in the magically-expanded residential trunk, the two spent the morning in their usual training routine -- and in Elysia's case, bleeding off the tension from the morning's revelations. When noon rolled around, Elysia shifted into her androgynous Harry-shape and, after shrinking the trunk and pocketing it, headed downstairs to inform her relatives that she would be leaving for the rest of the summer. She found them at the table, just starting in on lunch.

"Where'd you get those clothes!?" Dudley accused.

"Stole them, no doubt," Vernon said.

"Birthday present from my godfather," Elysia lied smoothly. "You know, Sirius Black? The escaped mass-murderer?"

The Dursleys paled. "Er, right," Vernon choked out.

"Anyway, just wanted to let you know. I'm leaving to stay with some school friends for the rest of the summer, and I'll get to the school from there on my own."

"What makes you think you're in any position to just come in here and *tell* us what you're doing, *boy?*" Vernon growled.

"I learned something interesting this summer," Elysia said, grinning evilly. "You know how I'm not allowed to use a wand outside of school?"

Vernon nodded cautiously.

Elysia snapped her fingers, conjuring a ball of Hermione's favorite bluebell flames in the palm of her hand. "I don't need a wand to do magic. Between that and Sirius, I rather think *you're* the ones who need to re-think their positions, don't you?"

Petunia gasped. Vernon nodded quickly, his many chins jiggling grotesquely. Dudley simply bolted up the stairs.

"Go on, then," Vernon snapped.

Before he could say anything further, Elysia disapparated.



### Granger House, Crawley	1994/08/21	11:59

Elysia and Robbie appeared on the Grangers' doorstep with twin *pops* of displaced air. As Elysia was just about to knock, the door flew open and, with a cry of "Ellie!" suddenly her arms were full of her favorite bushy-haired brunette.

"Hey, 'Mione," Elysia said, squeezing her back. "Ready to go?"

She nodded, finally letting Elysia go before leading the way inside. "Thank you for teaching me that wandless shrinking charm, Ellie! I managed to fit so many more books in my trunk!"

Elysia giggled. "Of course you did. Hullo, Drs. Granger!"

"Hello, Ellie," Dani replied.

"Long time no see," Emerson grinned.

"Ellie, I've just thought of something," Hermione said. "You're not out to the Weasleys yet. Should Robbie and I call you 'Harry' again until that changes?"

Elysia thought for a bit. "Yeah, probably, at least when it's not just us. Not sure I want to let on how much I've changed yet; you know how Ron can get. And anyway, we still don't know how the magical world takes transgender people in general, much less their beloved *Boy-Who-Lived.*" She sneered the last part.

Hermione patted her arm comfortingly. "Well, whatever happens, we'll get through it together."



### The Burrow, Ottery St. Catch-Pole	1994/08/21	12:05

After saying their goodbyes to Hermione's parents, Robbie popped the three of them to the lane outside the Burrow's front gate. Elysia was still in Harry-shape, and Robbie was still in human-shape as they'd come from a muggle area. Over their bond, the two giggled at how the Weasleys might react to Robbie's appearance as they walked toward the Burrow's front door. Hermione set Crookshanks down, and, spotting a gnome, he darted off to chase it.

Arthur Weasley opened the door as they approached. "Hello, Harry, Hermione, a- Oh my. Molly?" He called back into the house. "Does Ron have a twin I didn't know about?" He winked at them. "Come in, you lot. Molly's just finished making lunch."

The Burrow was more crowded than usual. It turned out that, when Ron had said that "we're all going ('cept Mum)," he'd meant *all* of the Weasleys (aside from Molly). Ron, Ginny, and the Twins were in the living room chatting with the two oldest Weasley boys, Bill and Charlie.

Ron looked up and caught sight of them. He stopped mid-word, looking back and forth between Elysia and Robbie, and gaping like a particularly large-mouthed fish. "Harry? Bloody hell, mate!"

Ginny looked up, caught sight of Elysia, and blushed bright red.

"Language, Ronald!" Hermione snapped, but she was smirking as she did.

"See, Hermione? I told you it'd be funny," Robbie said.

"Hullo, Weasleys!" Elysia said. "This is Robbie."

Robbie finally shifted back to elf-shape and bowed elaborately, cackling all the while. The twins applauded.

"Quite the entrance, wouldn't you say, Forge?"

"Yes, indeed, Gred."

"Anyway, honorary Weasleys, meet the oldest of the bunch --"

"Bill --"

"And Charlie."

The twins gestured to the oldest two in the room. Charlie was built like the twins: stocky and strong, with callouses visible from across the room and a shiny burn scar on one arm. He had a broad, good-natured face which was covered in freckles.

Bill was a surprise. Elysia had expected an older version of Percy from what Ron had said about him in the past: Head Boy, worked for Gringotts. She'd imagined someone fussy, bossy, and self-important. The reality, though, was that while he was tall and lanky like Percy (and Ron, for that matter) he could easily have been Percy's evil twin. He had long hair pulled back in a ponytail, dragonhide boots, and an earring with what looked like a fang dangling from it. All in all, the impression was more rock-star than anything else.

"Nice boots," he said.

Charlie leaned forward excitedly. "Ooh, are those Ukrainian Ironbelly? Ooh, and Hebridean Black?" He added, catching sight of Robbie's ensemble. "Where did you find these?"

"My family's storage vault," Elysia answered. "I got curious after everything last year, so first day back Robbie and I went to Gringotts to see if there was anything interesting. Found a bunch of clothes, my parents' and grandparents' journals, and a few other odds and ends. It's nice to have clothes that actually fit."

Ron had made his way over finally, having replaced his jaw. "Well, you look great, mate," he said, clapping Elysia on the back.

"Lunch is ready, everyone! Please help carry it all out!" Mrs. Weasley called, appearing from the Kitchen. "Oh, hello, dears. We're eating out in the garden; there's too many to fit comfortably inside."

Robbie darted over. "I'll bring everything out for you, Mrs. Weasley."

"Thank you... Robbie, I presume?" Mrs. Weasley said. "Harry, Hermione, why don't you take your things up? Harry, you're in Ron's room, and Hermione, you're with Ginny. And bring Percy down with you when you're done, please." She turned back to the kitchen. "Merlin knows that boy works so hard; he needs his energy."



+++++



Elysia, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny trooped up the stairs. Ginny and Hermione split off at the first door up the stairs, which was Ginny's room, while the other two continued to the top of the stairs, where Ron's room was.

Elysia hadn't been here since the summer before last, when Ron and the twins had broken her out of Durzkaban after Robbie had ruined one of Vernon's business dinners. It was still awash in Chudley Cannons Orange. Scabbers' -- Wormtail's, rather -- old cage was gone; in its place was a cage containing the ball of owl-shaped energy which had delivered Hermione's invitation last night. The owl was bouncing around the cage and twittering excitedly.

"It's a bit tight in here, sorry," Ron said, squeezing his way in. Somehow there'd been four beds stuffed inside the room. "Fred and George are in here too, because Bill and Charlie have their room," he explained. "Percy gets to keep his all to himself, though, because *he* has to *work.* Git. He *has* an office, you know!"

Elysia just rolled her eyes, pulled out her trunk, un-shrunk it, and shoved it under the bed next to Ron's.



+++++



Lunch was a raucous affair. 

It started with Bill and Charlie making the tables duel out on the lawn, causing Percy to stick his head out the window and yell at them to stop making so much noise. Then, with a squeak, Mrs. Weasley's wand turned into a giant rubber mouse, causing her to yell at the twins about something called 'Weasley's Wizard Wheezes.' 

Eventually, everyone had taken their seats. Elysia had Hermione on her right and Robbie on her left, with Bill, Ron, and Ginny across from them. The conversation wandered all over, from Charlie's work with dragons in Romania to Bill's curse-breaking adventures for Gringotts in Egypt, to some of the adventures Elysia, Hermione, and Ron had had at Hogwarts. 

"Wait, the basilisk was *how big?*" Charlie exclaimed.

"'Bout five feet wide, maybe sixty long?" Elysia replied. "Didn't exactly stop to check, you see, on account of the *fangs the size of my arm.*"

"Bloody hell," Charlie breathed.

"Can we change the subject?" Hermione asked, nodding at Ginny, who had gone pale and shaky.

"Please," Elysia said.

"Alright, then," Charlie agreed. "Sorry, Gin. Harry, heard you're Gryffindor's new seeker."

"Youngest in a century," Ron bragged. "He's never failed to catch the snitch, either. Well," he amended, "except for that one time when the dementors swarmed him."

"*Not helping,* Ron," Elysia said through gritted teeth.

"Anyway," Charlie continued, "I was a pretty fair seeker myself, in my day. Care for a seeker's duel?"

Elysia smirked. "You're on!"



+++++



When lunch was over, and the aftermath cleared away, everyone trooped down to the clearing in the orchard which was used as a makeshift quidditch pitch by the Weasley kids.

Charlie, riding a brand new Cleansweep 9, pulled out a snitch and grinned. "No hard feelings when I flatten you, eh, Potter?"

Elysia pulled out her shrunken Firebolt. Leaping astride even as it unshrank, she grinned devilishly. "You talk too much, Weasley."

Charlie's eyes bugged out, and he gulped. "A *Firebolt?* You have a *Firebolt!?*" He squeaked.

Ron cackled.

Even going best of five, it was a short duel.



+++++



They all went to bed early that night. Mrs. Weasley had offered to pick up Elysia and Hermione's school things, but Elysia was using her mother's old textbooks and Hermione had gone with her parents as soon as the letters had arrived.

"Even the dress robes?" Mrs. Weasley asked Elysia.

"Yes, Mrs. Weasley," Elysia said. "I found some in my parents' storage vault that suit very nicely."

"Well, if you're sure, dear," she said. "Now, get to bed. You'll be up at the crack of dawn to get to the Cup."



+++++



"Harry seems different," Ginny said to Hermione as they lay awake that night.

"Oh?" Hermione replied. "How so?"

Ginny tossed and turned for a bit, then rolled over to face Hermione. "Lots of ways. New clothes and such aside, he seems more self-assured, but also less... edgy, I guess? Softer around the edges, somehow. Kind of girly, actually. Not that he's ever been all that buff or anything, just..." She shrugged. "It's weird. I thought boys were supposed to get handsome as they got older. Him, though? First word that comes to mind to describe him is 'pretty.' It's confusing, honestly."

"Still crushing on the Boy-Who-Lived, Gin?"

"And the boy who saved my life two years ago," Ginny retorted. "You should've seen him, Hermione, with that sword in his hands and that giant snake dead behind him. It was like something out of one of those *Harry Potter* storybooks, only better!"

"I *have* seen him, remember? He saved me from that troll in first year, and he even ran off over a hundred dementors with a single *Patronus* just a few months ago." Hermione sighed. "You know Harry doesn't think he's anything special. He *hates* how famous he is, and how much of a fuss everyone makes over the Boy-Who-Lived stuff. Even if he *is* a hero in his own right."

"D'you think... maybe he's started to accept that finally, and that's why he's changing?"

Hermione snorted. "That or puberty. Honestly, my money's on the latter."

Ginny sighed.

"You really need to let that crush go, Ginny. Has he shown any sign at all that it's requited?"

"No, I don't suppose he has," Ginny said sadly. "He treats me like I'm his little sister. As if I need yet another big brother!"

"He's always wanted siblings. And anyway you could do worse for a brother than Harry."

Ginny scoffed. "I have! You've met Percy! Git has barely said two words to any of us that wasn't yelling at us to be quiet since he started at the Ministry."

"Still," she continued after a moment, "the ways he's changed remind me of a friend of mine." She sighed. "If Harry *does* turn out a girl, like her, I don't suppose it would change my chances one way or another. Pretty sure even *Charlie* has a better shot than me at this point. But it *does* have me thinking. *Do* I like girls? I suppose even thinking about it means I probably do, at least a little bit."

Hermione hummed noncommittally.

"What about you, Hermione?" Ginny continued.


"What *about* me?" Hermione retorted.

"Do *you* like girls?"

"Why Miss Weasley, are you coming on to me?" Hermione teased.

Ginny blushed. "Um. Are you? No, I mean..." She shook her head. "Answer the question."

Hermione thought for a while. "Well... I've certainly never found any *wizards* all that attractive."

"Oh really?" Ginny said. "What about Lockhart? I recall you being quite starry-eyed at Flourish & Blotts that year. And what about those hearts in your planner?"

"That ponce?" Hermione scoffed. "He wrote the books. I always get a little bit star-struck when I get to meet an author. There was certainly no *attraction* there." She shuddered. "And blame Lavender for those blasted hearts. Girl had _no_ sense of boundaries back then. She's still a bit hazy on the subject, truthfully."

"Alright, alright," Ginny said. "Then what about girls?"

"What about them?"

"Hermione, you know what I mean! Stop trying to wriggle out of it!" Ginny stuck her tongue out.

Hermione stuck hers out right back, surprising the younger girl.

"You've changed too, Hermione," Ginny said softly.

"In a good way, I hope?" Hermione asked, hesitantly.

"Yeah." Ginny said, smiling softly. "Even if you *are* still a swot."

Hermione huffed. "Oh, *I'm* a swot? D'you know what Harry wants to do after Hogwarts?"

"Play quidditch for England?" Ginny asked.

Hermione snorted. "Enchanting. He wants to be an enchanter. Or 'artificer,' as he calls it. Apparently the two are different somehow."

"But don't you need Runes and Arithmancy for that?" Ginny asked, surprise colouring her tone.

"He got Professor McGonagall to let him drop Divination and test into them instead."

"Wow, wonder what brought *that* on," Ginny mused.

"His grandmother's journals, probably," Hermione answered. "She was apparently quite good at it. Had some novel ideas about modular rune schema."

"Okay, so you're a swot and he's a boffin," Ginny hummed. "You're still dodging the question, you prat! Do you or do you not play for the Harpies?"

Hermione laughed in shock at Ginny's euphemism, then huffed. "Fine. Sure. 'Sweet mother, I cannot weave -- slender Aphrodite has overcome me with longing for a girl.' Is that a problem?"

"Why would it be?" Ginny asked, confused.

"It's controversial in the muggle world," Hermione said. "I wasn't sure how the magical world felt about sexuality and gender identity and all that."

"Nobody cares, as long as the bloodlines are continued," Ginny responded, "and there's rituals and such for any families that can't or won't have a child the usual way."

"Huh," Hermione said.



## Chapter 7: The Quidditch World Cup

Morning came too soon even for Elysia, who was already in the habit of rising early. The sky was still dark when Mrs. Weasley shook everyone awake.

"It's time, dears," she said. "You've got a bit of a hike ahead of you."

Eventually all of the kids in the house were roused, readied, and rounded up.

"Why aren't Bill, Charlie, and Percy awake yet?" Ron asked petulantly.

"Well, they're of-age, aren't they?" Mrs. Weasley answered. "They're apparating later. You lot need to catch the portkey."

Ron grumbled incoherently under his breath.

Mrs. Weasley gave them each a hug and a bundle of egg sandwiches as she chivvied them out the door.

After hiking through the cold darkness of the pre-dawn morning, up a dew-slippery hillside for nearly an hour, they finally reached the top of Stoatshead Hill, where they encountered the Diggories. Amos, the father, had a bad habit of bragging about his son to the detriment of everyone else, especially Elysia. Cedric, the son, to his credit was thoroughly embarrassed about it, but Hermione locked eyes with Elysia and, over passive legilimency, sent: *doesn't he just have the most* punchable *face?*

It was all Elysia could do not to laugh out loud at that.

Eventually, everyone managed to arrange themselves so they could all reach the portkey, which turned out to be a mangy old boot. Elysia and Hermione bent their knees and, alone of the group, managed to stay standing when they arrived at their destination.

"Seven past five from Stoatshead Hill," a voice said.

Mr. Weasley chatted with the two wizards who seemed to be coordinating portkey arrivals, getting directions to their campsite. After checking in with the muggle in charge of the site, who kept needing to be *obliviated* (according to one of the Ministry workers, anyway), they finally reached the field where all of the tents were.

Elysia could see why the muggles kept catching on. Most of the tents looked as if they'd at least *started* as normal, non-magical tents, but here and there someone had slipped up and added something absurd, such as a chimney or a weather vane. And there were a few which were so outré they could only be magical. There was one which looked straight from *Arabian Nights,* with striped silk awnings and several live peacocks tethered by the door. Another resembled nothing so much as a miniature castle, with three floors and honest-to-Merlin *turrets.* 

Eventually, they reached a plot next to a wooded area, with a sign planted in it saying 'WEEZLY.'

"Best spot in the place," Mr. Weasley said happily. "Stadium's just through the trees there. Now, strictly speaking, we shouldn't use magic while we're out on muggle land in these numbers. We'll have to put the tents up by hand!"

"Oh," Robbie said. "Oops?"

They all turned to find that Robbie had already set up the two tents they'd brought. Mr. Weasley looked a bit disappointed, but the relief on his children's faces was plain.

"Um, Mr. Weasley?" Hermione asked. "How're we going to fit so many people into only two tents?"

"Why don't you take a look inside?" Mr. Weasley said with a wink.

Elysia and Hermione entered one of the tents to find what appeared to be a three-bedroom flat, complete with kitchenette and bathroom.

"It's like my trunk, then," Elysia murmured to Hermione quietly.

"One day you're going to have to give me the tour," Hermione replied.

Mr. Weasley roped Elysia, Hermione, and Ron into going to collect water for tea, largely as an excuse for them to explore.

They ran across several classmates: fellow Gryffindor Seamus Finnegan, whose tent was covered in Shamrocks, sitting with his mum and his best friend, Dean Thomas; Oliver Wood, Gryffindor's former quidditch captain, who had just signed to Puddlemere United; Ernie Macmillan, who was a Hufflepuff in their year; and Cho Chang, a pretty girl who was the seeker for Ravenclaw's quidditch team. She waved to Elysia, who winked back flirtatiously, causing Cho to blush and Hermione to giggle.

"Bloody hell, mate, you're a dangerous one," Ron quipped. "Where'd *that* come from?"

Hermione smirked.

"It's easier when it doesn't matter, I guess," Elysia said.

"Doesn't *matter?*" Ron retorted, incredulously. "What, are you into blokes or something? That's *Cho Chang!* She's the prettiest girl in school!"

"To you, maybe," Elysia said. "And no, I'm definitely not into blokes. She's just not my type, I guess. Personality clash." She shrugged. "Besides, isn't she with Diggory?"

"Yeah, so? She's still gorgeous!" Ron said.

"Methinks the Weasley doth protest too much," Hermione snarked.

"I think you're right," Elysia smirked. "You sure you're not into blokes, Ron? Viktor Krum, maybe?"

Ron scowled.

"Maybe just Harry," Hermione laughed.

Elysia winked at Ron, grinning, and waggled her eyebrows. 

Ron flushed. "Prat!" He said, stomping off ahead of them.

Elysia rolled her eyes. "Boy takes himself way too seriously for someone related to Fred & George."

"Percy," Hermione retorted. "And to be fair," Hermione continued, biting her lip, "you *are* much too good at that look."

"It's not so hard," Elysia scoffed. "You try."

"I don't think that's really my style," Hermione replied.

Elysia studied her for a moment. "Fair enough. You're more the 'doe-eyed innocence with a hidden wicked streak' type, I think."

Hermione assumed a 'who, me?' face, but it failed miserably as her lip kept twitching. They both burst out laughing.



+++++



They returned to find Mr. Weasley playing with matches, and the twins 'supervising.' Hermione took over, and, with a surreptitious wandless _incendio,_ eventually they had a fire going. Mr. Weasley kept up a running commentary on all the Ministry workers passing by as they waited for the fire to die down to cooking coals.

Bill, Charlie, and Percy walked up from the apparition point in the woods just as the coals were ready. They all sat around the fire cooking sausages on sticks (the sandwiches Mrs. Weasley'd sent them with having been devoured long since).

Ludo Bagman, the head of the Department of Games and Sports at the Ministry, dropped by and tried to get them to bet on the match. Mr. Weasley bet a galleon on Ireland to win. Fred and George almost bet their life savings on Ireland to win but Krum catching the snitch, until Elysia took them aside and mentioned that she'd heard rumors that Bagman liked to pay out his books with leprechaun gold, and the goblins weren't too happy about that. So they bet 10 galleons and a fake wand instead, and Elysia promised, if their business plan was good enough, when she reached her majority she'd invest enough in Weasleys' Wizard Wheezes for them to set up shop in style.

Then Bartemius Crouch, Percy's boss and the head of the Department of International Magical Cooperation, apparated in and dragged Bagman away, berating him over the Bulgarian delegation requesting twelve more seats in the Top Box. Bagman went, dropping hints about some big mystery event at Hogwarts this year.

Since their seats were also in the Top Box, Elysia decided she'd better pop into her mindscape and see if there were any language books, and leaned back in her seat with closed eyes.

> To Do
>
> - [x] Stop the Twins from betting and losing their life savings
> - [x] Find and read the primers on French, Bulgarian, Irish Gaelic, Scots Gaelic, Welsh, Russian, Latin, Greek, Indonesian, Mongolian, Nepali, Amharic, Korean, Japanese, Vietnamese, Greek, Spanish, Aquitanian, Modern Basque, Swiss, Swedish, Icelandic, Khmer, and German

As the afternoon wore on, the lanes between the tents began to fill with salesmen, hawking souvenirs of all sorts. Ron purchased a dancing shamrock hat; an animated figurine of Viktor Krum, the Bulgarian seeker; and a large green luminous rosette.

Elysia's attention was drawn to a cart full of brass binoculars covered in dials and knobs. The salesman called them 'omnioculars,' and explained all about the functions. Elysia decided to buy a set for everyone in their party. Ron tried to argue, but she insisted. "Consider it my way of paying your family back for getting me a seat in the Top Box."

They got back to their campsite, where Elysia handed around the omnioculars. They'd just gotten everything squared away when a gong boomed out through the campsite, and green and red lanterns lit a path through the woods.

"It's time!" Mr. Weasley exclaimed, leading them excitedly down the path.



### World Cup Stadium	1994/08/22	20:00

On the other side of the wood stood a *massive* stadium which seemed to be made of gold, or more likely brass. They climbed all the way up to the Top Box, which was situated exactly halfway between the goalposts on either end of the pitch. The box had an open area in the back, where they all entered, and three rows of ten seats each up front, overlooking the pitch.

They were almost the first to arrive, so they all filed into the front row. Robbie conjured a seat on the left end, with Hermione next, then Elysia, then Ron next to her. In the second row, behind Hermione, sat the only other occupant of the box -- another house elf, who was trying valiantly to ignore the exceedingly high view over the railing.

"Winky?" Robbie said, surprised.

"Dobby?" The other elf said. "But -- you is wearing clothes!"

"It's Robbie now," Robbie replied. "I'm a Potter elf." For Robbie was wearing the uniform he'd found in the storage vault, with the Potter crest displayed proudly upon the left breast. He was still wearing his dragonhide boots and jacket, though. "And Harry's brother," he added proudly.

Winky gasped. "Is this true, sir?" She asked, turning to Elysia. "Is Harry Potter taking in a trouble-maker like this one and giving him ideas above his station?"

"Robbie is family," Elysia said firmly. "We take care of each other. I don't think Robbie's a trouble-maker at all, or at least no more than I am."

Hermione snorted softly at that.

"And I'm sure I don't know what you mean by 'ideas above his station,'" Elysia continued. "Magic says he's my brother, and he behaves as a brother should."

"Brother!" Winky squeaked. "Begging yous pardon, but Harry Potter bes just as odd as Robbie."

"Why thank you," Elysia grinned.

Winky shuddered and went back to hiding from the heights.



+++++



The box slowly filled over the next half hour. Mr. Weasley and Percy kept shaking hands with VIPs as they entered. Minister Fudge came in with the Bulgarian Minister, who seemed to not speak a word of English.

"Ah, Harry, my boy!" Fudge exclaimed by way of greeting.

"Good evening, Minister," Elysia replied. "No dementor bodyguard this time?" 

Fudge scowled. "Now see here --"

She cut Fudge off by turning to the Bulgarian minister, and greeted him in his native tongue. *"Good evening, sir. I'm sorry for your loss."*

*"What loss?"*

*"Why, the hours of your life you'll never get back from having to deal with the shameless exhibition of incompetence we Brits are unfortunate enough to call our Minister."*

The Bulgarian minister and his staff roared with laughter.

*"What's this about a dementor bodyguard?"* He asked.

*"He put dementors around Hogwarts all last year,"* Elysia said. *"Nearly killed me and many other children on several occasions. And all to catch a Lord of an Ancient and Noble House who'd never even had a trial. Bit of a habit with him, from what I've seen. Makes you wonder if the man can even tie his own shoes without nearly asphyxiating himself and throwing the cobbler in prison."*

The entire Bulgarian delegation turned to face Fudge with menacing glares.

"When did you learn Bulgarian?" Hermione hissed. "And what did you say?"

"Tell you later, 'Mione," Elysia whispered back.

"Ah, Fudge," Lucius Malfoy said as he swept in with his family. Elysia was doubly disappointed, both for the presence of the Malfoys and the interruption to the rising tension between Fudge and the Bulgarians.

Mr. Malfoy introduced his wife and son to the Minister. Draco caught sight of Elysia and blushed, but turned away with a scowl when she smirked at him.

Before tensions could ramp up again, Ludo Bagman waltzed in. "Everyone ready?" He exclaimed.

"Please, Ludo," Fudge said.

Once everyone had finished taking their seats, Mr. Bagman cast a *sonorus* on himself and introduced the Bulgarian mascots.

The mascots turned out to be a hundred veela, who began to dance enticingly. Elysia could feel the magic of their allure tickle the edge of her mind, but it couldn't get through her occlumency shields. Still, she found the display enjoyable. Then she noticed Hermione leaning forward far enough to be dangerous, and pulled her back.

"Down, girl. You're drooling a bit," she murmured into Hermione's ear. "Put your shields up and watch the boys make fools of themselves."

Hermione's glazed look cleared up as she shook herself, and smiled gratefully at Elysia. Turning, the two of them watched as the Weasleys -- and both Draco and his mother, though Lucius Malfoy, Charlie, and Mr. Weasley all seemed more or less unaffected -- postured absurdly. Even Ginny had started to stand, when the music stopped and the veela took their places on the sidelines.

"*Ahem.* And now," Mr. Bagman said, his voice cracking at first, "the Irish National Team Mascots!"

Elysia, Hermione, and Robbie giggled to each other as everyone else seemed to shake themselves from their daze with some embarrassment.

The Irish mascots, a swarm of leprechauns, put on a spectacular display of aerial acrobatics, showering the crowd with gold coins in the process. Ron hurriedly gathered up all he could, until Hermione leaned over and told him that it would disappear in a few hours anyway.

And then the game began in earnest.

It was a brutal affair, with the quaffle moving so fast it was only due to the omnioculars that anyone could keep track of it. Viktor Krum managed to pull off a Wronski Feint against Aiden Lynch, the Irish seeker, causing him to crash into the ground at full speed, and the game only got dirtier from there. Ireland began to pull ahead, bludgers flew every which way, penalties mounted, the mascots began to fight, and finally, with the score 170 to 10 favoring Ireland, Krum managed to plow Lynch into the ground again and grab the snitch, ending the game at 170 to 160 before it could turn into a full-on rout. 

"Vell, ve fought bravely," the Bulgarian Minister said.

"You can speak English!?" Fudge said incredulously. "You've been letting me mime everything all day!"

The Bulgarian Minister shrugged. "It vos funny." 

Elysia caught his eye and burst out laughing.

> To Do
>
> - [x] Mess with Fudge



+++++



Everyone was too keyed up to sleep when they finally made it back to camp, so they all sat around the campfire with mugs of hot cocoa.

"Harry," Hermione said, "what did you say to the Bulgarian Minister? And since when do you speak Bulgarian, anyway?"

"The 'how' is that my grandparents invented something called 'Language Lozenges[^1],'" Elysia answered, lying through her teeth. "Don't think they ever got the chance to market them; Granddad's journal mentions them right near the end, just before they caught the dragon pox that killed them."

"So, what, you found a stash of prototypes or something?" Hermione asked.

"Yup!" Elysia said. "Russian, both Irish and Scots Gaelic, Bulgarian, Polish, Hebrew, French, Spanish... all kinds, really. It's brilliant. Pity he didn't write down the formula."

Hermione nodded.

"Anyway," Elysia continued, "I took a few before I left the Dursleys. Figure, the Cup is an international event, right? Might be nice to understand some of the more international discussions."

"You're mental, mate," Ron said.

Elysia smirked. "No, 'mental' is what I said to the Bulgarian Minister." She relayed what she'd said.

"Harry James Potter! You did *not* just instigate an international incident!" Hermione admonished, laughing.

"Hey, Fudge is the dementor-happy one!" Elysia retorted. "I was just telling it like it is!"

"You have no proof of Sirius Black's innocence, Harry," Percy said stiffly.

"Proof?" Elysia retorted. "My own experiences last year aside, which I will swear to, or testify on under veritaserum? It's right there in black-and-white in my parents' wills. Which were sealed on Dumbledore's orders, by the way. And guess who cast the *fidelius* in the first place?"

Mr. Weasley looked uncomfortable. "I'm sure he had his reasons."

Elysia scoffed. "I'm sure he did. But that doesn't change the facts. Not like I can do anything about it anyway. So how about that Wronski Feint?"

The conversation, though stilted at first, slowly grew more spirited again as they recounted the match. Until, that is, Ginny started snoring. Mr. Weasley finally sent them all to bed.

Elysia, however, remembered Janet's warning, and began carving border stones for an anti-apparition ward. When the screams started and Mr. Weasley came in to tell them all to run, she told Robbie to lay the stones around the Death Eaters, then dutifully woke everyone.

Casting a wandless illusion-construct of herself running with her friends into the woods, she shifted into a gorgon and apparated in front of the Death Eaters, just outside her anti-apparition ward. In the ensuing panic, she managed to catch fully half of them in her petrifying gaze before the rest tried to apparate. When that failed, she caught another quarter of the remainder. By then ministry workers were starting to arrive, so she apparated back to the tents, shifted back to Harry-shape, and popped to where her illusion-self was. All in all it took maybe five minutes.

> To Do
>
> - [x] Neutralize the rioting Death Eaters

"Harry? You okay?" Hermione called at the loud crack that sounded as Elysia joined them.

"Stepped on a branch," Elysia replied, thankful it was so dark in the woods. She'd not been missed.

"Oh, this is stupid," Hermione said, pulling out her wand. "*Lumos.*"

A beam of light shone from the tip, illuminating Draco Malfoy leaning casually against a tree.

"Careful, Granger," he taunted. "Wouldn't want to call attention to yourself with that lot. They're hunting muggles, you know."

"Hermione's a witch!" Ron growled.

"And anyway, I don't think they're hunting much of anything anymore. D'you hear any screams? Or spellfire?" Elysia taunted. "Might want to go check on daddy dearest." She made her eyes flash green with a surreptitious wandless illusion, grinning maliciously at Malfoy's flinch.

Before things could escalate, they heard a hoarse shout from deeper in the woods. "*Morsmordre!*"



+++++



Later, Mr. Weasley told them that they'd found Winky the house-elf with Ron's wand, and that, while the wand showed the Dark Mark spell when checked, nobody honestly believed that either Ron (who had witnesses as to his whereabouts the whole time) nor Winky had actually cast it. Winky, who turned out to be Bartemius Crouch's elf, had been summarily given clothes and dismissed.

"It was a sorry sight," he lamented. "Poor thing was sobbing her heart out."

Eventually everything settled down enough that they could return to the tents and get some sleep. Even Elysia managed, despite the shakes from an absolutely brutal adrenaline crash. It was still an early morning, though, as Mr. Weasley woke them before sunrise to catch the return portkey back to Stoatshead Hill.

A distraught Mrs. Weasley greeted them on their return, waving the morning edition of the Daily Prophet. The headline blared: "DARK MARK OVER WORLD CUP! DEATH EATERS PETRIFIED UNDER MYSTERIOUS CIRCUMSTANCES!"

"Arthur!" She called out as they approached. "Is everyone okay?"

"Fine, Molly," he replied. "It was the strangest thing. By the time we got to the Death Eaters, they were almost all petrified. Oh, there were a few left, but none of them even tried to disapparate. We managed to catch every single one, aside from whoever conjured that Dark Mark."

*Did you manage to clear out the anti-apparition stones before the clean-up crew got there?* Elysia asked Robbie over their bond.

*Yup!* He answered proudly.

*Awesome! Thanks, bro!*

"What're you grinning about?" Ron asked suspiciously.

"Mr. Weasley," Elysia asked, with a pointed look at Ron. "Was one of those caught a certain Lucius Malfoy, by any chance?"

A look of understanding dawned on Ron's face.

"Well," Mr. Weasley replied, "can't say for sure. Ongoing investigation and all, y'see, and none of them have been un-petrified yet. But I wouldn't be surprised," he said with malicious glee. "Rumor has it that the Malfoys had broken camp sometime in the night, and aren't reachable this morning."

Everyone in earshot smirked at that, even Mrs. Weasley. There was no love lost between the two families.

The moment was broken when Elysia let out an enormous yawn, and Mrs. Weasley sent them all up to bed. Elysia realized she'd not had a proper night's sleep in two days, and was out as soon as her head hit the pillow.

## Chapter 8: The New Girl

The remainder of the summer passed quickly. Percy and Mr. Weasley were at the Ministry more often than not, dealing with the aftermath of the World Cup and the Death Eaters, not to mention that mystery event everyone kept hinting at.

Much to the delight of everyone, Lucius Malfoy had indeed been one of those petrified in full Death Eater regalia. He, along with the rest of those captured, were sentenced to a minimum of a year in Azkaban for muggle-baiting and causing an international incident, among other things -- they all were raided by the DMLE for cause, as well, leading Malfoy, at least, to a longer sentence.

"Couldn't happen to a nicer bloke," Ron said when he heard.

"Wonder how Draco's going to handle it," Elysia mused. "I imagine either he'll be keeping his head down or he'll be on a hair-trigger."

The other big thing that happened occurred at dinner the day after they returned from the World Cup, after Hermione had relayed the relevant part of her and Ginny's conversation from the other night.

"Hey, everyone? This summer's been an interesting one, and I've learned a lot about myself. And I need to share one of those things with you all." She took a deep breath. "I'm a girl. My name's Elysia now, or Ellie for short."

"Well *that* figures," Ginny said, then blushed deeply when she realized she'd said it out loud.

Ron looked conflicted, alternating between relief and worry. Elysia, noticing, grinned. "Steady on," she told him. "Still not into blokes."

Hermione got a thoughtful look on her face. "So what're you going to do about Hogwarts?"

Elysia hummed. "Good question. I suppose I should write Professor McGonagall again."

"Again?" Asked Fred. "And why --"

"-- would you be --" George continued.

"-- writing our esteemed professor --"

"-- over the summer?"

"Because I wanted out of Divination," Elysia answered. "She said I can test into Arithmancy and Runes, and if I do I can drop Divination."

"Well, we'll move you into Ginny's room with the other girls while you're here, dear," Mrs. Weasley said.

"Have you gone shopping for girl clothes yet?" Ginny asked.

"Some," Elysia shrugged. "I rather like the androgynous look, though. It gets some pretty great reactions."

Every single Weasley in the room except the adults blushed bright red at that. 

Hermione couldn't keep the smirk from her face. "It kind of says, 'I don't care what your sexuality is, you're definitely questioning it now.'"

Elysia raised an eyebrow at her, grinning. "Oh *really?*"

Hermione, despite her caramel complexion, blushed the brightest of them all.

> To Do
>
> - [x] Come out to the Weasleys



+++++



Elysia wrote Professor McGonagall (and Sirius, while she was at it) as soon as dinner was finished. The next day, her answer came while Elysia and Hermione were sitting in the back garden, going over what Elysia would need for the Arithmancy and Runes qualifiers. The Weasleys gave them a wide berth; none of them wanted to spend the last few precious days of summer *studying.*

> Ms. Potter,
>
> Thank you for informing me of this change. I'll update your file and accommodations accordingly. And yes, I'll avoid mentioning it to the headmaster. He does so get worked up over you to excess, and this is certainly none of his business.
>
>Will you be undergoing the transition ritual at St. Mungo's before term starts?
>
>  -- Professor Minerva McGonagall
>   Deputy Headmistress
>   Hogwarts School of Witchcraft & Wizardry

"There's a ritual for that?" Hermione asked.

"Apparently," Elysia said. "I'll just tell her yes. No need to tip my hand about the shifting just yet, though I think I might change my eyes to mess with people a bit. D'you think I should change my hair?"

"How do you mean?" Hermione asked.

In answer, Elysia shifted her still-short hair to auburn, then shifted some black streaks in, then shifted to black hair with bright red tips.

"Ooh, I like that last one," Hermione said. "It's quite striking."

Elysia shifted back. "I'll have to duck out for a day to give myself an alibi, then. Robbie can take me; that should reassure Mrs. Weasley."

"What are you going to *actually* do?" Hermione asked.

"Well, you *do* have a birthday coming up..."

### Hogwarts Express    1994/09/01  10:50

Despite Mr. Weasley being called into work for an emergency that morning, they still made it to Platform 9^3/4^ with 10 minutes to spare. As they made their way down the train, Fred and George broke off to sit with Lee Jordan and the chasers from the Gryffindor quidditch team. Elysia, Hermione, Ron, and Ginny continued on, finding that all of the compartments were full.

Finally, they came to one with only a single occupant: a girl with long, pale blonde hair and wide blue eyes, wearing Ravenclaw robes, who was reading a magazine upside-down.

"Hullo, Luna," Ginny said, opening the door. "May we join you?"

Luna looked up from the magazine she was reading. "Certainly," she replied in a dreamy voice.

"Everyone, this is Luna Lovegood. She's in my year," Ginny said, introducing them to Luna as they all filed in.

Elysia took the seat next to Luna, with Hermione on her other side and Ron and Ginny across from them.

"Whatcha reading?" She asked, leaning over.

Luna smiled absently. "The Quibbler. My father runs it."

"Neat," Elysia said. "Ooh, is that a rune puzzle?"

"So *that's* why it's upside-down," Hermione muttered under her breath.

"Yes," Luna said airily. Hermione looked abashed at being overheard. "Mother was a spell-crafter before she died, and she'd taught me Runes and Arithmancy ever since I was old enough to remember. Daddy runs the rune puzzles as a sort of memorial to her."

"I'm starting those subjects this year," Elysia said. "Professor McGonagall let me test into the 4^th^-year classes."

"Me too!" Luna exclaimed, pleased. "Well, I have yet to take the qualifying exams, of course, but I don't expect any problems."

"Same," Elysia said. "Hermione's made sure I haven't missed anything."

The three began discussing both Runes and Arithmancy with much enthusiasm. Ron and Ginny looked at each other in bemusement.

A few minutes later, Neville Longbottom joined them, taking the empty seat between Ron and Ginny. The discussion was already going so strongly, none of the other three even noticed at first, until Neville spoke up to say hello.

"Oh, hullo, Nev," Elysia said.

Neville blushed. "Do I know you -- *Harry!?*"

"It's Elysia now," she replied. 

"Oh," Neville said faintly.

"Hi, Neville," Hermione said, stifling a giggle. "How was your summer?"



+++++



A ride on the Hogwarts Express wasn't complete without Draco Malfoy stopping by to make a nuisance of himself.

"Potter!" He blustered, banging open the door to their compartment. "Um..."


Elysia stood, and stalked to the door. Draco gulped.

"Hello, *Draco,*" She growled. She ran a finger across his jaw, channeling a Jelly-Legs Jinx. He flushed as his knees gave out and he tumbled out into the hallway, knocking over Crabbe and Goyle. Elysia smirked, slammed the door shut, and locked it with several locking charms. "Goodbye, Draco!"

As she retook her seat, the compartment exploded in laughter.



+++++



The rest of the trip passed uneventfully, though pleasantly. Elysia's new-found confidence helped draw out the normally-shy Neville, and Luna found much in the way of common ground with both Elysia and Hermione. Her tendency to talk about creatures nobody else could see, or believed existed, notwithstanding, she easily kept pace with the two older girls intellectually.

Finally, they arrived at Hogsmeade Station and disembarked, with a wave to Hagrid which made the large man do a double-take. As the six of them approached the horseless carriages, Luna made a detour to the front of one, tugging Hermione's hand.

"Here, pet this," she said, placing Hermione's hand on *something.* Elysia raised an eyebrow. While she couldn't *see* anything, it was apparent that Hermione could *feel* something under her hand.

"Luna, I..." Hermione said. "I'm sorry I doubted you. What *are* they?"

"They're thestrals," Luna answered softly.

"I know about those!" Neville said. "You can only see them if you've seen someone die."

"Yes," Luna said wistfully. "They have a bad reputation because of that. But really they're quite gentle."

Elysia stepped closer to pet the thestral. Luna guided her hand to its flank. "It's kind of leathery, but soft," she told the others. 

Hermione had stepped back and was studying Luna. "Your mother?"

Luna nodded. "When I was nine. There was nothing I could do."

Hermione gently hugged the younger girl. "I'm sorry," she said softly.

They filed into the carriage after a last pat for the loyal thestral, and made their way up to the castle.



+++++



The storm that had been threatening all day finally broke on the way up from Hogsmeade, and despite the short dash from the carriages to the entry hall, they were all soaked to the skin by the time they made it indoors.

Just when they thought they were safe, water balloons began pelting them from above, soaking them once more -- not that Elysia felt it made much difference, really.

"PEEVES!" McGonagall yelled, dashing out of the great hall. 

After chasing off a cackling Peeves, the students were ushered into the Great Hall.

"Great, I'm soggy *and* starving," Ron grumbled. The others could only agree.

"Next time, _impervius_ charms on _everything,_" Elysia said.

Luna split off to the Ravenclaw table, and the others took seats midway down the Gryffindor table. Elysia scanned the staff table, noting that there were more empty seats than usual. One, she presumed, was Professor McGonagall's, and another was Hagrid's, as both were busy with the first-years. And then it clicked: the remaining empty seat was the Defense Against the Dark Arts teacher.

"Wonder who they got for DADA this year," she murmured to the others.

"Maybe they couldn't find anyone," Hermione said pensively.

"Maybe Peeves got them," Ron said. "Wish they'd hurry up with the sorting, I'm ravenous!"

Elysia scanned the staff table again, and caught the eye of Professor Snape. She'd seen plenty of people do double-takes over her this summer, but this was the first time she'd seen someone pale so drastically at the same time. *Looks like he's seen a ghost,* she thought to herself.

Professor McGonagall entered with the first-years, and as Hagrid took his seat the Sorting commenced. It was the first one since Elysia's own that she'd managed to see, as the past two years something had always come up. Colin Creevy's little brother, Dennis, was sorted into Gryffindor, and Elysia giggled to herself as Colin tried to point out 'the famous Harry Potter' to him but didn't recognize her.

The Sorting wrapped up, and the feast appeared. Everyone dove in with relish, and Elysia pondered how it was that she could be so hungry after stuffing herself silly with snacks on the train ride.

Finally, dessert was devoured and the plates cleared. Dumbledore stood, and gave out his usual start-of-term notices. "It is my painful duty to inform you that there will be no Inter-House Quidditch Cup this year," he added, amid rising murmurs of shock and dismay from across the Hall, "due to an event starting this Halloween and continuing through the rest of the year. It is my great pleasure to announce that this year, Hogwarts --"

Several things happened at once, and Elysia couldn't help but admire the theatricality of it all. Thunder crashed, the doors to the Great Hall flew open, and a bolt of lightning flashed in the enchanted ceiling, illuminating a figure who looked as if he'd been born to the storm. His face was scarred, weathered, and craggy, with one piercing electric-blue eye, which rolled around independently of the other, which was a beady black and yet much more normal for that. He had a peg leg, shaggy hair the dark grey of storm-clouds, and a black traveling cloak billowing in the door's back-draft. All in all, Elysia thought even Snape would be hard-pressed to make a more dramatic entrance.

The figure made his way down the Hall to Professor Dumbledore, with whom he spoke quietly for a moment before taking the vacant DADA seat at the staff table.

"Allow me to introduce Retired Master Auror Alastor Moody," Professor Dumbledore said, "our new professor of Defense Against the Dark Arts."

The students' whispering among themselves reached a crescendo. Moody himself ignored them, and looked to be casting detection spells on his dinner. As Elysia watched, he took as swig from a hip flask.

"*Mad-Eye* Moody?" Ron said incredulously. "*That's* our new DADA professor?"

"The one your dad was called about this morning?" Hermione inquired.

Ron nodded. "That's him. He's supposed to be a legendary auror; caught more than his fair share of Death Eaters back in the war."

"As I was saying," Dumbledore continued, "Hogwarts will this year play host to the newly-reconstituted Tri-Wizard Tournament."

A chill of foreboding trickled down Elysia's spine.



+++++



The conversation was of the upcoming tournament as they all made their way to Gryffindor Tower. Ron and the twins were lamenting that they were too young, and discussing schemes to get around the Headmaster's Age Line.

"Better you than me, mate," Elysia said. "I'd rather a nice normal year for once."

Elysia almost followed Ron to the boys' dorms, but remembered at the last minute and turned to follow Hermione instead. *That's going to take some getting used to,* she thought to herself.

The girls' dorms were a mirror image to the boys' dorms. Hermione had the bed by the window, and Elysia's bed had been inserted between hers and Parvati Patil's.

"I was wondering whose bed that was," Parvati said. "Hello, new girl!"

Elysia grinned as she loosened her tie. "Hullo, Parvati. How was your summer?"

Parvati squinted at her. "How do you know my name -- wait a minute. *Harry!?*"

"It's Elysia now," she responded. "Or Ellie for short. Turns out that was a nickname of my mum's back in the day. Y'know, L. E.? Lily Evans?"

"Damn," Parvati said. "Right heart-breaker, you are. D'you have any idea how many girls are going to be disappointed that you've turned out to be one of us?"

Lavender Brown came in from the bathroom, took one look at Elysia, blushed furiously, and ducked back into the bathroom.

Elysia smirked. "Probably not that one?"

Hermione couldn't contain her giggles anymore. "That never gets old, Ellie!"

Elysia waggled her eyebrows at her, and over passive legilimency, sent, *especially when it's you getting flustered.*

Hermione's eyes widened and she squeaked, flushing deeply. "Um. I." Her brow furrowed and she squeezed her eyes shut, shaking her head. "Damn it, Ellie!"

Elysia laughed. "Language, 'Mione!"

Parvati giggled. "Woah, there, Heart-Breaker. You still need to sleep here, y'know."

Elysia favored her with a raised eyebrow. "What'd *I* do?"

Parvati crossed her arms and mock-glared. "You know what you did, young lady," she said sternly, waggling a finger. All three of them burst into giggles as Lavender braved joining them again, mock-pouting.

"It's just plain *unfair,*" she said, flopping down on the bed nearest the door. "You were so striking as a boy, and now you're *this* cute? The boys won't know what hit them."

"Ugh, do I give off straight vibes?" Elysia grumbled.

"Well, no, not so much I suppose," Lavender answered. "But you know how boys are."

"I guess," Elysia said. "Can't say they've ever made much sense to me."

"'Straight vibes?' Wait a minute..." Lavender said, then promptly blushed again.

"How *do* you flag for Sapphic-ness in the magical world?" Hermione mused. "In the muggle world there's things like accent nails and the handkerchief code."

"Short fingernails?" Lavender shrugged. They all blushed as the implications hit, avoiding each other's eyes.

"Dunno that anyone thinks enough of it to feel like they need to," Parvati mused, dragging the conversation to safer ground. "Signaling's a thing for muggles because of the controversy, right? But it's not controversial for us, so no need to be covert about things."

"It's more about how you behave and who you flirt with," Lavender added. "Though that tomboy look you've got is uncommon enough that you'll probably get lots of attention from everyone anyway. Even if you *did* change your eye color. How'd you do that, anyway?"

"Colored contacts," Elysia hummed. "Y'know, normally I don't like to stand out. But it's kind of fun when it's not because of that Boy-Who-Lived stuff, or because people are afraid of me, like when everyone thought I was the Heir of Slytherin. Hey, Lavender, Parvati?" She asked. "Can you not let everyone know about my transition? I want to enjoy their reactions while I can." She grinned mischievously.

"Sure thing, Heart-Breaker," Parvati said, grinning back. "This is gonna be *good.*"



### Hogwarts, Great Hall	1994/09/02	07:15

The next day was a Friday, and the first day of classes.

"History of Magic first thing? *And* double Potions? Great start to the year," Ron groused as Professor McGonagall passed out the schedules.

"At least we get a weekend right after," Elysia said, taking a seat at the Gryffindor table next to Hermione.

"Ellie? Where were you this morning?" Hermione asked, handing Elysia her schedule.

"Working out," Elysia answered as she filled her plate. In past years, she'd leaned towards the traditional pancakes, sausages, and other less-than-healthy breakfast foods, but this morning Hermione noticed a much more balanced selection. "Got into the habit over the summer. Especially with quidditch canceled this year, I need it to burn off the stress."

"What're *you* stressed about?" Ron asked. "It's barely the first day back!"

Elysia shrugged. "Nothing, yet. But you know how Hogwarts can be. And I've already got the habit; seems easier to just keep going with it."

"Mind if I join you, then, Ellie?" Hermione asked.

Elysia nodded, and was just about to reply, when -

"Good morning," Luna said from behind them.

Hermione jumped. "Luna!" She gasped. "Don't *do* that!"

Luna wrinkled her nose. "Say good morning?"

"No, not that," Hermione stammered. "I meant sneaking up on me."

"I'm sorry, Hermione, I didn't mean to," Luna said. "The wrackspurts do seem thicker than usual around here for this early in the term, so maybe that's why you didn't notice?"

"Maybe," Hermione agreed with a bemused smile. "Luna, what exactly *are* wrackspurts, anyway?"



## Chapter 9: Clearing The Air

### Hogwarts, Potions Classroom	1994/09/02	13:00

History was uneventful, aside from the many odd looks people kept giving the 'new girl.' Charms, on the other hand... When Professor Flitwick called out "Potter, Elysia" during roll, many of those looks changed to shock, and Elysia heard more than one person mutter, "oh, that's just *unfair!*"

But all of that was nothing compared to Potions. Friday afternoons were double periods with the Slytherins (*always the Slytherins,* thought Elysia. *Do they* want *explosions?*), and the look on Malfoy's face as she entered was *priceless.*

"Didn't realize Malfoy could get any more pale," Ron muttered.

"And now he's blushing," Hermione added.

Elysia smirked as the trio took their seats, Hermione sharing a table with Neville and Elysia with Ron. "He didn't even glare at me in the Great Hall today. Must've shaken him more than I thought on the train."

"I'd've thought Hermione's right hook would've done that last year," Ron replied.

Hermione grinned bashfully at that, while Neville's eyes went wide. "Wait, what? When did you *punch Malfoy?*"

"His daddy wasn't doing time in Azkaban last year, though," Elysia said. "And it was after Creatures last year, Nev, when Hagrid found out that Buckbeak was going to be put down. Malfoy was gloating, and Hermione wasn't having it."

Just then Professor Snape swept into the room, in his usual dramatic fashion. He caught sight of Elysia, turned around, and walked right back out again, the expression on his face never changing.

The students all looked at each other, most of them trying their hardest not to giggle. Finally, Elysia caught Neville's eye and they both burst out laughing.

"What just happened?" Neville wheezed, finally catching his breath.

"Wish I knew," Ron gasped.

They'd all just settled down again when Professor Snape came back in, pointedly avoiding looking in Elysia's direction.

"Potter, stay after class. Now, everyone turn to page..."



+++++



Elysia packed up with the rest of the class, but stayed seated as the other students filed out. Finally, only she and Professor Snape remained, eyeing each other warily.

She wasn't really surprised when she felt the legilimency probe. She'd always figured that if *anyone* could read minds, it was Snape, and now that she knew what to look for, she could follow the probe straight back to its source.

Apparently her resemblance to one Lily Evans was much more obvious now, to Snape at least, and it had shaken him.

*Subtle, Russ,* she sent along the commandeered probe, using the childhood nickname her mother had come up with for Snape. She watched gleefully as his eyes widened in shock, and smirked in a particularly Lily-ish way as she grabbed the probe and *tugged* Snape into Elysium.

They manifested in the living room to find James and Lily waiting for them. Before anyone else could say anything, James stood.

"Severus, I owe you an apology for everything back in our school days. We were all terrible and for my part I'm sorry."

Snape abruptly sat down, gaping, as his knees gave out. "What-? How-?"

"I think you broke him, Dad," Elysia giggled.

Snape shook his head to clear it. "Where are we? How are you here, now, *speaking* to me?"

"We're in my mindscape, Professor," Elysia answered. "Long story short, I died, got a whole bunch of afterlife training stuffed into my subconscious, and got sent back to the start of this past summer with a mindscape and memory-constructs of my parents. For all intents and purposes, they *are* my parents, at least their minds."

Snape stared. "*Mindscape? Memory-constructs?*"

"I don't actually *remember* the afterlife," Elysia continued, "or any past lives. But this way I at least have them around to give me parental guidance. Not like Aunt Petunia was ever any good for that, certainly."

"Wait. You live with *Petunia?*" Snape exclaimed, aghast. "I'm going to *kill* Albus."

"Get in line," Lily growled. "And on that note, I've got a bone to pick with you."

Snape gulped.

James ushered Elysia outside. "We don't need to be there for this part," he said. "What say we go flying 'til they're done?"




+++++



Eventually Elysia and James returned to find a much-chastened Snape.

"Ms. Potter," Snape said, somewhat hesitantly. "It seems I owe you an apology for my treatment of you these past years. There was no excuse and I shall endeavor to better my behaviour, both towards you and in general."

"Mum set you straight?" Elysia asked, trying to suppress a grin.

"At great length and substantial volume," Snape agreed sardonically. James stifled a laugh. Lily smacked him in the arm, trying (and failing) not to grin.

"Can't say better than that," Elysia said with a shrug. "Clean slate, Professor?"

"I would very much appreciate that, Ms. Potter," Snape replied.

"Why'd you hate me so much, anyway?" Elysia asked. "If you don't mind me asking."

Snape sighed. "It's not so much you as what you represented, really. When I looked at you, I saw proof that I'd lost my best friend, and that she'd taken up with one of the bullies who made my life miserable. I saw James Potter's taunting face every time, looking at me through Lily's eyes, and every time it reminded me that the only person who ever gave a damn about me was gone forever."

James looked stricken upon hearing this. Lily got up and gave Snape a hug. To Elysia's shock, he returned it.

"And Neville?" Elysia asked, once Snape had regained his composure.

"Aside from the fact that he's a bigger lab safety hazard than Seamus 'Sparky' Finnegan?" Snape said, with a grimace. "All I could think when I looked at him was, 'why couldn't _he_ have been the Prophecy Child?' And then I felt guilty for thinking that, and guilt and self-loathing lead to a rather unpleasant place."

He sighed. "You and I, we have a lot in common, Potter. Elysia. We both grew up abused, neglected... unloved. Looking back, it was so obvious, and I could kick myself for ignoring the signs. It warps you, makes you think horrible things are normal." He looked at her with haunted eyes.

She gazed back, eyes just as haunted. "It does. And it never really goes away, does it? The scars. The doubts. That endless refrain of 'what did I do to deserve this?'"

Lily was silently weeping. 

"You've changed, Elysia," Snape said. "Transition aside, you carry yourself differently. Like you know your own worth. And not in an over-compensating way; it's as if many of those scars have healed, much more than they ought to have in just a few short months."

Elysia sat silently, gathering her thoughts, then snorted. "Honestly, they were an eternity from my perspective. Janet?" She called.

"Hi!" Janet said, popping into existence in the middle of the sunken living room. Her chipper demeanor was a sharp contrast to the somber mood of everyone else, and Elysia found it to be a welcome relief.

"Janet," Elysia said, lip twitching with a repressed grin, "can you explain to Professor Snape how I'm no longer the hot mess I was last term?"

Janet smirked, locking eyes with Snape. "In short? We cheated like mad." A book appeared in her hand, which she passed to Snape.

"_Processing Trauma,_" he read. Opening the book, his eyes widened and he finished reading the entire volume in a matter of minutes.

"How?" He gasped as he closed the book. "It's as if I've undergone _decades_ of therapy!"

"There's more to mind magics than legilimency and occlumency, Professor," Elysia said. "Wasn't sure this would work, though, no matter what Janet said." She shot Janet a look, at which Janet stuck out her tongue.

"Of course it worked!" Janet said. "We had all the time in the world to make sure of it."



+++++



"Oh, by the way, d'you want that tattoo of yours removed?"

"You can do that? Yes, please!"

"_Lotu askatu!_"



+++++



"One last thing, Russ," Lily said. "That prophecy? The one you overheard, that caused Albus to ruin so many lives? Trelawney faked it because she thought it'd get her hired."

"_WHAT!?_"



+++++



After returning to the real world only a scant few minutes after entering Elysium, Elysia made her way to dinner as Professor Snape finished squaring away his classroom. She caught up with Ron and Hermione at the doors to the Great Hall.

"What'd Snape want?" Ron asked.

Elysia thought for a moment. "Honestly? I think he had a bit of an identity crisis seeing me not looking like my dad anymore. Anyway, we cleared the air a bit."

"Think you can clear the *way* a bit, while you're at it?" Malfoy's voice said from behind them. "Some of us would like dinner."

"Shove off, Malfoy," Ron started, stepping towards him.

"Ron --" Elysia started, even as she and Hermione stepped out of the doorway. But it was too late, Malfoy and Ron were already hurling insults and ignoring everyone else.

"Honestly, those two," Hermione muttered to her, rolling her eyes.

"Right? They're like sodium and water," Elysia replied. "You'd think their flirting would've moved past tugging on each other's pig-tails by now," she added, rather more loudly.

Hermione burst out laughing, even as both Ron and Malfoy both shot her a dirty look.

"And anyway," Ron said, turning back to Malfoy, "at least *my* dad's not in the paper for being an evil git! Does you mum prefer him as a glorified lawn ornament, or as dementor chow? My bet's the statue -- probably the only time it's gotten hard since she had you!"

Ron had clearly gone too far. With an inarticulate growl, Malfoy pounced on him, knocking them both to the floor, scattering students in their wake as they wrestled around.

"Here now, what's all this? Break it up, you two!" Professor Moody came down the stairs. The boys ignored him, so with a grunt he drew his wand and cast a stream of pale blue spell-fire at them. Elysia's glasses identified it as a free-form human-to-animal transfiguration, and sure enough when the light faded they saw two long, furry creatures, still locked in combat. One had white fur, the other red.

"Break it up, I said!" Professor Moody waved his wand again, and the two creatures began bouncing up and down on the floor of the Entrance Hall, exactly as if Moody were dribbling a basketball.

"Alastor!" Professor McGonagall shouted, dashing down the stairs towards them. "What in Merlin's name are you doing?"

"Teaching," Moody answered, still focusing on the two bouncing creatures.

"Are those *students!?*" McGonagall shrieked, launching into a rant about the proper way to discipline students, which was apparently _not this._

As Moody's distraction caused the bouncing to let up, Elysia and Hermione scooped up the creatures and petted them soothingly on the back. "Aww, you're so much more pleasant like this," Elysia cooed to the white ferret she was holding.

"Maybe we should ask Professor McGonagall to leave them like this for awhile," Hermione suggested with a smirk. 

The white one actually seemed to relax somewhat at that, but the red one started wriggling frantically and making an odd growling noise.

"Ugh, stop squirming! Okay, _fine,_ Ron!" Hermione said exasperatedly, setting him down.

"It's easier sometimes, not having to be a person, right?" Elysia murmured to the unexpectedly-relaxed white ferret. "Nobody expects anything from you. Life is simpler."

The little fur-ball looked up at her, surprise showing clearly even on its ferrety face.

"Maybe you should give some thought to what _you_ want from your life," she continued, scritching the ferret behind the ears, "and not just what everyone _expects_ of you. Life might suck less. Or, you won't have to pretend to be someone you're not as often, which I think counts. Worked for me, at least. Anyway," Elysia said, setting the ferret down, "time to get changed back. But think about what I said, yeah?"

The ferret looked at her for a long moment, then scampered over to where McGonagall was waving her wand over the red-furred weasel.

## Chapter 10: A Busy Weekend

The next morning, so early the sun hadn't yet crested the horizon, Elysia woke with a jolt. She'd been having such a compelling dream, but it was fading so fast... and it was gone. Damn.

She rolled over and tried to go back to sleep, to no avail. Eventually, she dropped into Elysium to start her morning routine with a check of the List and a chat with her parents.

Coming back to the real world, she found Hermione was just waking up.

"Still want to join me and Robbie for our workout, 'Mione?'" She asked.

"It's 'Robbie and I,'" Hermione corrected with a yawn.

"Aha, so you *are* awake!" Elysia crowed.

Hermione threw a pillow at her. "Alright, fine," she grumbled, fighting off another yawn.

The two finished their morning ablutions and joined Robbie by the lake for a run. After a few laps, they returned to the dorms, where, since it was still quite early on a Saturday morning, the other girls snored away quietly.

Elysia opened her trunk and started down the stairs, only to look up at Hermione's gasp. She grinned at Hermione's astonished expression, and beckoned her to follow.

Hermione's eyes were wide as Elysia gave her the grand tour of the little flat she shared with Robbie. She made sure to end the tour in the locus room, because as soon as Hermione set foot inside she was off, examining every little thing and chattering a mile a minute. Elysia leaned against the doorjamb, a fond smile on her face as she watched her best friend's excitement.

Hermione trailed off as she noticed Elysia's expression. "What?" She asked, hiding bashfully behind her hair.

"You know I literally wrote that rune schema in like four hours, right?" Elysia said, grin widening.

"Oh, um, right," Hermione said sheepishly. "I forgot you wrote it."

"I must say, Miss Granger, I'm flattered by your enthusiasm for my work," Elysia said in a faux-posh accent.

"Well, Miss Potter," Hermione retorted, playing along. "Your work _does_ show remarkable sensibilities, especially given the constraints under which it was performed."

"Why thank you."

"Certainly."

They laughed, and headed out to finish their workout.



+++++



By the time they were done, breakfast was well underway. The two reached the Great Hall just as Luna came down the stairs.

"Good morning," she said with a happy-sounding, adorably squeaky yawn.

Elysia and Hermione caught each other's eyes and, over passive legilimency, at the exact same time, sent the exact same thought: _oh no, she's so cute!_

"Good morning, Luna," they chorused back.

"Are you ready for the Arithmancy and Runes exams?" Elysia continued.

"Certainly," Luna replied. "I expect it will be nice to feel challenged in my classes finally. And you, Ellie?"

Elysia grinned. "Definitely. Gotta keep Hermione on her toes, after all. I've been slacking too much. Divination, honestly. What on earth was I thinking?"

"Probably that it was an easy O, if I recall," Hermione said mock-primly. Luna giggled.

"You'd think I'd know better than to let myself get bored by now," Elysia grinned. "That way lies mischief."

Hermione snorted. "Mischief's in your blood, Ellie. I'm just glad you're not a prankster like your father and his marauders, or the twins. The castle would come down around our ears."

Elysia winked at Luna. "No worries there. Can't have poor Professor McGonagall's pretty black hair going grey, now can we?"




+++++



After breakfast, both Elysia and Luna followed Professor McGonagall (and her 'pretty black hair,' as always done up in a severe bun) to their Arithmancy qualifier, which was mostly - but not entirely - theory at this level. They broke for lunch, chatting with Hermione about it while Ron eyed them all askance.

"Still say you're mental, Ellie," he muttered around a mouthful of roast beef.

"Ron, d'you know what you can _do_ with Arithmancy?" Elysia retorted. "I just watched Luna modify Professor Vector's spell _in flight._ Granted, it was just a paintball spell, and she only changed the color, but _still._ It was one of the coolest things I've ever seen!" She grinned at Luna, who beamed back.

"You monkey-patched a spell _in flight,_ Luna?" Hermione squealed. "That's incredible! I've read that's a top-tier dueling technique! It's incredibly tricky."

Luna flushed under the effusive praise. "I suppose it is," she replied. "Professor Flitwick can do it. It's something my mother was known for, too, back when she was a professional duelist. She was Professor Flitwick's protégé before she retired to have me and became a spell-crafter."

Ron, who thankfully had swallowed his food first, gaped.

"Of course," Luna continued, "it's not very practical. You need lightning reflexes to manage even the simplest of spells. But it does look rather impressive, doesn't it?" She grinned.

"I'll say," Elysia gushed.



+++++



After lunch was the Runes qualifier, which both girls completed in record time. Professor Babbling looked like Yule had come early.

"Between you two and Miss Granger, I might actually get to hold an independent study track this year," she gushed. "It'd be a shame to hold so many brilliant minds back, now that there are enough of you to make a case for it."

Hermione was ecstatic when Luna told her at dinner. "Do you think we'll be able to learn about warding and curse-breaking?"

"Perhaps a bit," Luna replied. "Those _are_ rather advanced topics, after all."

"I can't wait," Elysia grinned.

None of them noticed the speculative look one Albus Dumbledore was giving them from the staff table.

The next morning, after their usual training routine, Elysia and Hermione sat across from each other on the mat. Today they were going to try bringing Hermione into Elysium.

"Are you sure this will work, Ellie?" Hermione asked nervously.

"I'm like 99% sure," Elysia replied with a grin. "Your passive linking is solid, and your active linking is loud and clear. It's just like diving into a memory, yeah? You've done that before."

"I know," Hermione pouted. "You know how I get, though."

"All up in your head?" Elysia snorted. "Hermione. You'll be in _my_ head. I'll be right there with you every step of the way."

Hermione took a deep breath and puffed it out. "Okay. Let's do this. _Legilimens._"

Just like with Snape, Elysia caught Hermione's mental probe and gave it a solid tug, and they both appeared in the dueling ring outside the cottage in Elysium.

Hermione gasped as she looked around. "Oh, Ellie, it's so pretty!"

Elysia giggled. "Wait 'til you see the inside. C'mon, I'll introduce you to my parents." She led the way into the cottage, Hermione gazing all around in wonder.

Lily and James were waiting for them in the sunken living room. 

"So this is the 'best friend' I've heard so much about! A pleasure, milady," James said, bowing with excessive flourish. 

Lily smacked him upside the head. "Hello, Hermione. It's nice to meet you."

Hermione smiled. "Hello, Mr. and Mrs. Potter."

"Hey now, none of that 'Mr.' stuff," James said. "I didn't die this young just to be addressed like my father. Call me James."

"Not Prongs?" Hermione asked in a deceptively innocent tone. "How do you feel about 'Bambi?'"

Elysia and Lily snickered as James face-palmed.

"I _like_ this one!" Lily exclaimed, pulling Hermione into a one-armed hug.

"Me too," Elysia winked at Hermione. "I think I'll keep her."

Hermione bit her lip, clearly holding back a comment of some sort, causing both Elysia and Lily to grin even wider.

"Somebody's a bad influence!" Lily sang.

"How about you give me the tour, Ellie?" Hermione said with a huff.

Elysia grabbed her hand and they were off. Hermione was confused by the workshop, given that Elysium was a mindscape, but Elysia just said "prototyping and simulations," and that explained it all as far as Hermione was concerned. Finally, the tour ended in the study, where Janet greeted them.

"Hi, I'm Janet!" She greeted Hermione cheerfully.

Hermione's eyes were as big around as Slytherin's basilisk at the sight of the bookshelves. Elysia elbowed her. "Oh! Um, hello, Janet," she stammered.

"Hello, Hermione," Janet replied, smiling.

"Janet's basically the embodiment of all knowledge in the universe," Elysia told Hermione casually.

Hermione's eyes bugged out.

"I'm not _that_ Janet, though," Janet said. "I'm just the embodiment of all knowledge in Elysia's head."

"Close enough," Elysia said. Grinning, she grabbed Hermione's hand again before the bushy-haired bookworm could dive into the stacks. "Woah, there. Don't overdo it or you'll be bored to tears all year!"

Janet handed Hermione a book, with a list tucked into the cover page. "Here, start with these for today. You should read that last one too, Elysia," she continued, handing her another book.

> - Hogwarts' Hidden History: What Hermione's Favorite Book Won't Tell You

Smiling fondly as Hermione settled into one of the armchairs by the window and began devouring the book, Elysia settled in and devoured her own. Something suddenly struck her as she finished, and she went over to the desk.

"_Morgana's rack,_" she breathed. "Janet? Does this mean what I think it means?"

Janet came over. "If you think it means that Moldy Voldy keeps shooting himself in the foot, you're dead on."

Just then, they were interrupted by a shrieking Hermione. "_WHAT!?_ You mean this one _stupid_ ward is setting back Muggle-Magical relations by _centuries_ all because wizards were too lazy to put up an actual lightning rod!?" She devolved into incoherent shrieks of fury.

"Um, 'Mione?" Elysia said, putting a calming hand on her shoulder. "You know we can fix it, right?"

Hermione took a deep, gasping breath and held it for a 5-count, letting it all out in a sigh. "I know, Ellie. It's just, how are magicals so constantly lacking in common sense? 'Too much magic' indeed. And that single anti-lightning ward prevents entire _classes_ of magic from being even _discovered,_ much less _taught,_ and it just makes me so mad I could scream!"

"Honestly, Hermione? Scream. Go off. And when you're done, we'll see who wants to go on a little adventure to fix it. Because everything else aside, I _really_ want to have movie nights sometime."

Hermione took a deep breath, stood, and let out an ear-splitting roar of utter fury. 

"Feel better?"

"Much," Hermione replied, panting.



+++++



After cleaning up, the pair made their way down to breakfast, again meeting Luna at the entrance to the Great Hall.

"Good morning, you two," Luna greeted them with another adorably-squeaky yawn.

"Good morning, Luna," they chorused, grinning.

Luna stared at them for a moment. "Do you two practice doing that?"

Elysia and Hermione looked at each other. "Doing what?"

Luna cocked an eyebrow. "And people call _me_ loony," she muttered under her breath, fighting a giggle.

"So, Luna," Elysia said. "O Magnificent Mistress of the Monkey-Patch. Wanna go on an adventure with us?"

"Ooh, yes please!" Luna replied, bouncing on her feet happily.

"Breakfast first, you two," Hermione said. "We'll tell you all about it while we eat."

They found empty seats across from Ron, Ginny, and Neville, who were also invited.

"So what's this about, then?" Neville asked.

"Well," Elysia started, "You know how Hogwarts: A History says that muggle electronics won't work at Hogwarts because there's too much magic?"

Hermione let out a snort of fury as the others nodded. "It turns out," she growled, "that the original edition where that's brought up said that magicals _rely too much on magic,_ not that there's too much ambient magic. Someone set up an anti-lightning ward, centuries ago, and it stops electrical currents from working entirely. So stupid! All they had to do was transfigure a big metal stick on top of the highest tower, and run a grounding wire. But no, they put in an overly-broad ward and now whole _classes_ of magic don't work here!"

Ron and Neville gaped as she continued to rant. Ginny barely refrained from giggling.

Luna placed a calming hand on her shoulder. "We'll fix it, Hermione," she soothed.

"Heck yeah, we will!" Elysia crowed. "And then we can have movie nights!"

"What's a 'movie?'" Ron asked.

Elysia and Hermione looked at each other and grinned.

### Hogwarts Grounds, Scotland	1994/09/04 09:15

They decided to put up the lightning rod first, as a fail-over precaution. When the ward came down, there was a chance of built-up energy discharging, and having somewhere to discharge _to_ was probably a good idea.

First, they all congregated on the grounds. Elysia, Ron, and Ginny had their brooms with them. Hermione instructed them to gather a bunch of rocks, the redder the better (presumably because of iron content), so they all trooped over to the lake shore and made a pile of stones. Then Hermione waved her wand over it, turning it first into one big rock, then into a lump of metal, then drawing out the metal into a tall pole and a large metal spike, joined by a long coil of large-gauge cable.

"We should probably shield the cable..." Elysia mused, which led to them all gathering sticks and leaves. Hermione transfigured them into a sheet of rubber, then charmed the rubber into place around the cable. By the time she was done, Elysia had transfigured another stone into a metal plate, which was then transfigured into a junction box and connected to the cable. Luna then started carving runes of permanence into the transfigured materials, so they would keep their new form.

About an hour after they'd started, they had one lightning rod ready for installation. The three with brooms flew up to the top of the tallest tower, levitating the rod and stabilizing the cable as they went. The cable spooled out below them, as Neville, Luna, and Hermione kept control of the stake-end. Once the rod portion was standing up straight atop the tower's spire, Elysia transfigured the end of the rod to cap the spire snugly, and sealed it in place with permanent sticking runes. The three fliers then flew down the cable, using sticking charms and runes to affix the cable to the side of the tower, until they landed and Elysia drove the anchor stake deep into the ground with a powerful banishing charm. A few notice-me-not runes, and then they all stood back to admire their work.

"Wow, that looks rather good!" Neville said.

"And the wrackspurts are keeping away, too," Luna added.

"How about gremlins?" Hermione asked.

"I haven't noticed any of them either," Luna replied, "but as they feed on electricity they tend to avoid Hogwarts anyway."

"Well that's lucky," Ron said. "Come on, it's time for lunch and I'm _starving!_"

"My brother, the walking stomach," Ginny lamented.



+++++

### Room of Requirement, Hogwarts	1994/09/04 13:08

"Sufh wushf bha phlam?" Ron said around a mouthful of food (again).

"Step one: swallow your food before talking!" Hermione snapped with a glare. "Honestly, Ronald."

Ron swallowed with what looked like quite a bit of effort. "What's step two, then?"

Ginny face-palmed.

"Not here," Elysia said. "After we eat, we'll go somewhere to plan. In retrospect, this might take more time than we have left this weekend."

The others agreed, and after lunch Elysia led them to a corridor on the seventh floor, stopping to pace in front of a tapestry of dancing trolls.

_I need a place to plan an excursion to the Hogwarts Wardstone Chamber,_ she thought intently.

When they all filed into the Room, they found something out of a spy movie, with the highlights being a large conference table holding a live scale model of what appeared to be maintenance access tunnels, a workbench with rune-carving supplies, and shelves full of reference books. There were also several blackboards on wheeled stands scattered about.

"What _is_ this place?" Neville asked, looking around in wonder.

"It's the Room of Requirement, or as we elves call it, the Come-And-Go Room," Robbie said, appearing already seated at the model-bearing table with a quiet pop. "It turns into whatever you need it to be."

Neville looked at the model, looked at Robbie, and asked, "What if we need it to be a door straight to the Wardstone Chamber?"

Everyone else looked at each other for a moment, and the sound of six palms impacting upon six foreheads echoed through the room.

Elysia focused for a moment, and the model-laden table was replaced by a scale-model of the Hogwarts Wardstone Chamber[^2]. It was more of a cavern, really, and full of haphazard columns of an unidentifiable crystal, all of which were glowing softly in a rainbow of colors. Interspersed amongst them were shorter, stouter crystals of a deeper blue, as if they were made from deep ocean water made solid. All were carved over every visible inch with runes, all too small to make out at this scale. Two clusters of runes, on separate crystals, were glowing red.

"Goodness," Luna gasped.

"What are those red areas?" Hermione asked.

"I asked the room to show us where the lightning ward runes were," Elysia answered, "and also where the curse on the DADA position was, if it was there."

"Good thinking," Hermione replied with a smile. "Can you ask it to show us those specific clusters up close too?"

Elysia gestured to the blackboards lining the room, and two of them filled with annotated rune schema diagrams.

Luna had wandered over to a door which had appeared next to the original door, and cracked it open. "Oh my," she gasped. "Um, Ellie? 'Mione? You might want to take a look at this."

Hermione peered through the now wide-open door.

"Morgana's left nut," Hermione gasped.

Elysia snorted. Luna started giggling hysterically.

"These crystals are gargantuan!" Hermione exclaimed when she recovered. "Even the small ones are the size of a house! And those columns must be nearly a kilometer high!"

The others ambled over to stare through the doorway and stared in awe.

"Bloody hell!" Ron said.

"That model really doesn't do the real thing justice," Neville commented.

"We're gonna need more brooms," Ginny said.

Elysia grinned. "Maybe not. I've got a new spell to show you all."

+++++



Hermione, of course, had already picked up the Unlimited Flight spell from reading __Magical Mobility: From Apparition to Zero-Gravity__ in Elysium. So while Elysia taught the others how to fly unassisted, she started going over the rune schema diagrams on the blackboards. After a bit, Luna joined her.

"So this is the infamous curse on the DADA position," she murmured.

Hermione nodded. "It's hard to imagine just how much trouble this devious little cluster has caused, isn't it? Even in just the few years I've been at Hogwarts. First year, possessed by Voldemort, dead before the Leaving Feast. Second year, obliviated straight into the Janus Thickey Ward. Last year, run out of the castle for being a werewolf. It makes one wonder what's in store for Professor Moody this year, doesn't it?"

"Nothing good, I'm sure," Luna said. "Even if we _do_ break the curse, I think it's already been set in motion for this year."

"So what do you think," Elysia said, coming up behind them. "Just erase both clusters and call it good?"

"Can you do that?" Luna queried.

"_Kendu akatsa,_ right?" Hermione said. "Now I know why you said I should learn Aquitanian."

"Huh?" Luna said.

"The Potters have Basque roots," Elysia explained. "Over the summer I went through the Potter vaults, and found a bunch of old grimoires in Aquitanian. One of them had a bunch of spells to help with runes and sigils and such. Apparently the Potters were known for warding and enchanting at one point. Soul magic too, it turns out, because of golem-crafting, though those spells aren't all that useful most of the time. Anyway, _kendu akatsa_ got translated to modern Basque, and means roughly 'remove the blemish.' It's used for un-etching."

Luna made puppy-eyes. "Ooh! Can you teach me? Pretty _pretty_ please?"

Elysia blushed. "Um. And people say _I'm_ dangerous?"

Hermione snickered.

"Hey!" Elysia grumbled. "_You_ try resisting Luna's puppy-eyes and see how _you_ like it!" She turned back to Luna. "Of course I'll teach you. I was planning to anyway. Should come in handy for class, too."

"Yay!" Luna bounced up and down happily.

Elysia smiled fondly, and caught Hermione smiling too.

"So, back to the question at hand," Elysia continued. "Can we just erase them, or is it more complicated than that?"

"Well," Hermione started. "The lightning ward, I think we can just erase. The DADA curse, on the other hand..."

"Yes," Luna chimed in. "That one's a nasty piece of work. I'm not even sure what half these runes _are,_ much less what they do in concert."

"I say we flag it and come back to it later, then," Elysia said. "Like you said, it's already in effect for the year, so we've got time to figure it out before the next victim."

Ron, Ginny, and Neville, done practicing the flight spell, drifted over.

"So what's the plan?" Neville asked.

"The DADA curse is too complex to tackle today," Hermione answered, "but the lightning ward we think can just be erased. So I think we're just going to find both clusters, wipe the lightning ward cluster, and mark the DADA curse cluster so we can find it more easily when we're better prepared."

"Wait a minute," Ron interjected. "These are the _Hogwarts Wardstones._ Are we _sure_ we can just go in and muck about with them? Something like that, I'd expect at least _some_ protection."

Elysia stuck her head through the door, mage-sight and glasses active. 

"What're you doing, Ellie?" Luna asked.

"Thaumic analysis," Elysia answered absently, squinting at the shadowed edges of the cavern. "I picked up some new glasses over the summer, and they've got some neat little tricks built in." She neglected to mention that _she_ was the one who'd built those tricks into the glasses in the first place.

"Wait, what?" Hermione exclaimed. "And you didn't tell me? Rude!" She stuck out her tongue at Elysia, who stuck hers out right back. All three of them giggled.

"Anyway," Elysia said. "I don't see any wards active in the cavern proper, at least not from here. I'd wager that most of the protections are on the ways in and out, and since the Room of Requirement seems to have bypassed those, we should be in the clear. I'd expect the headmaster to notice when the wards change, though, so we'll have to be quick. Mark the DADA curse first."

"I should probably stay here and make sure the way back doesn't disappear on you," Neville said.

"Good idea, Nev," Elysia said. "Hadn't thought of that."

On a hunch, Elysia asked the Room to highlight any other problems with the wards. Several more clusters turned red. "Bollocks," she muttered. Several more blackboards filled with diagrams.

"What happened?" Ginny asked.

"I asked the Room if there was anything else wrong with the wards. Turns out there is."

Hermione looked over at the blackboards. "Bollocks."

"So we do the same thing with those as we do for the DADA curse," Luna said. "Maybe we can show them to Professor Babbling as an extra credit project."

"Bill might be able to help too," Ginny added. "He _is_ a curse-breaker, after all."

Elysia wandered over to the worktable and started carving a simple schema for a glowing red arrow illusion into some sandstone. "Here, everyone copy this and we'll stick them to the problem clusters."

Everyone else started copying the arrow stones, and Elysia grabbed a marker and started labeling each cluster on the blackboards.

"Anyone know a good locator spell?" She asked.

Everyone looked at each other. "Try asking the Room?" Neville eventually suggested.

Elysia did so, and a ghostly image formed over the table demonstrating a spell and repeating the words _monstrant viam._

"_Monstrant viam,_" she repeated, copying the wand movements and focusing on the blackboard with the lightning ward diagram. A softly-glowing trail of cyan light began at her feet and led to the blackboard.

"Ooh, that's _perfect!_" Luna squealed, eyes shining.

"Wonder if it'll work on the twins?" Ginny mused, smirking.

"I'll let you be the one to test that," Ron said. "Anyway, the arrows are done."

"Let's get to it, then," Elysia said. "Nev, Robbie, thanks for watching our backs."

Neville and Robbie took a seat at the table. The others lined up just beyond the door to the Wardstone Chamber, raised their wands in unison, and said, "_hegan egin mugarik gabe!_"

As they all rose into the air, whooping with delight, five trails of light streaked off into the cavern. Hermione headed for the lightning ward, Elysia took on the DADA curse, and the others busied themselves with the other 'clusters of concern,' as they'd been dubbed.

The DADA cluster proved to be on one of the shorter crystals, and as Elysia drew near her HUD lit up with field lines. As the analytics HUD started identifying them, she swore softly. "Hey, you lot!" She called out. "There's localized trap wards on this cluster! Fall back to the Room!" She did a cursory field trace, making note of the points of origin for the traps, and found they were buried in the cave floor.

"_Ventus,_" she muttered, clearing them off. She stared intently for a moment, memorizing them. She'd be able to break them down later in Elysium's workshop. Then she dropped her arrow to mark the field's edge and rejoined the others back in the Room.

"I managed to get the lightning ward, at least," Hermione reported.

"Wonderful!" Elysia crowed. "Now I can show you a nifty little spell I found in a travelogue from Hawai'i. It used to be used for fishing, and now apparently they use it on tourists who get too handsy. Room, if you would?"

The lights dimmed, and a metal pole rose from the floor, roughly as tall as Elysia. She raised her wand and jabbed it forward, intoning, "_limahana!_" A spark jolted from her wand with an audible crackle, arcing from the tip of her wand to the metal pole. She held it for a few seconds, the electric glow casting dancing shadows.

As she released the spell, the lights came back up and the pole retreated back into the floor.

"Bloody brilliant," Ron said.



## Chapter 11: Outclassed

### Hogwarts, Classrooms	1994/09/05 08:00

Monday morning found Elysia and Hermione once again greeting a yawning Luna outside the Great Hall at breakfast with fond smiles. Both girls had talked the night before about how quickly Luna had become their friend, and how much they both enjoyed spending time with her.

"I'm so excited for Runes and Arithmancy today!" Hermione gushed as the three joined their friends at the Gryffindor table.

"Me too!" Luna replied.

"Swots, the both of you," Elysia teased, and laughed as both girls smacked her on either arm in synchrony. "See? It's not just me and Hermione doing that."

"'Hermione and _I_,'" Luna absently corrected, eyes sparkling.

Elysia stuck her tongue out at her as Hermione giggled.

"And what, pray tell, do you plan on doing with that?" Luna asked, cocking one eyebrow.

Elysia's jaw dropped and she blushed brightly. "Um."

Hermione finally lost her composure completely and dragged them both to breakfast, cackling.



+++++



Monday morning was full of of harvesting bubotuber pus in Herbology with the Hufflepuffs, and mounting concern over something Hagrid called 'blast-ended skrewts' in Care of Magical Creatures. Professor Sprout had been forewarned about Elysia's transition, but Hagrid kept looking around for 'Harry' until Elysia came up and reintroduced herself. Elysia and Hermione met up with Luna again at lunch, and then the three of them, accompanied by Neville who was also in the class, headed off to Arithmancy.

Professor Septima Vector was a petite brunette with sharp bob-cut hair and a calculating gaze. She greeted the students with a smile. "This year," she said, "we will begin thaumic analysis. Some of you," she nodded at the three girls, "have demonstrated a degree of experience with this already. Miss Lovegood, if you would?"

Luna moved up to stand at the front of the classroom.

"I'm going to cast a beam of light. Miss Lovegood is going to demonstrate a technique called 'monkey-patching' wherein a spell's parameters are modified after it's been cast. First, here's the unmodified spell. _Lux trabem!_"

A beam of magic, glowing with white light, erupted from her wand, streaming the length of the classroom. She held the beam for a few seconds.

"Alright, Miss Lovegood, show us your stuff! _Lux trabem!_"

Luna, muttering a spell under her breath, flicked her wand in an intricate pattern and the beam split into a rainbow spectrum, lines of glowing white runes intertwined among them. She flicked a few specific places, and swished her wand with a flourish as the beam re-cohered. It was now a thin, intense rod of actinic blue, and was roughly three feet long. A low hum could be heard as Professor Vector slowly waved her wand around. 

Luna grinned, flourished her wand like a fencer, and intoned, "_ense lucis radium!_" A similar beam of glowing, humming magic, this one tinged with fuchsia, extended from the tip of her own wand. The two crossed the beams as if fencing, resulting in a cloud of sparks, then canceled the spells.

The class erupted in applause and cheers.

"I didn't know you'd seen Star Wars, Luna!" Hermione gushed as Luna retook her seat.

"We _definitely_ need a movie night soon," Elysia said.

The rest of the class was an overview and the beginnings of a deeper discussion about the techniques Luna had demonstrated. It turned out that Luna's lightsaber spell, _ense lucis radium,_ was one she'd helped her mother create before she'd died. It was intended as a training aide for fencing lessons, which Luna had continued after her mother's death as a way to still feel close to her.

"Luna," Elysia asked as class let out, "Hermione and I do some training ourselves most mornings. Maybe you'd like to join us? We usually start with a run around the lake about 5:30 or so."

Luna smiled as Hermione nodded enthusiastically. "I'd love to!"



+++++



After Arithmancy was Runes, which Professor Babbling had managed to wrangle as an accelerated track. In addition to Elysia, Hermione, and Luna, the class included Millicent Bulstrode and Tracy Davis from Slytherin, Lisa Turpin from Ravenclaw, and Susan Bones and Megan Jones from Hufflepuff. Hermione noted that there were two students from each house. Elysia noted that there were no boys. Luna noted, smirking, that she was pretty sure none of them were straight (including the professor, if the tattoo of a labrys wreathed in violets on her wrist was any indication).

"Well, ladies," Professor Babbling said with a grin. "Now that it's just the best and brightest this section, we get to jump right into the fun stuff." An enormous Cheshire-cat grin split her face. "Welcome to Curse-Breaking 101."

The girls all cheered.

"Now, you all have a solid grounding in Futhark and Ogham," she continued. "This term, each of you will pick another glyph system to specialize in, and we'll begin to look at the basics of warding and enchanting. Next term, we'll dive into practical applications with some training scenarios, and in our last term of the year we'll have a mock boot camp with some guest instructors from Gringotts."



+++++



The girls all made their way to dinner together after Runes, chattering away excitedly. Elysia, Hermione, and Luna all split off and made for the Gryffindor table, joining Ron, Neville, and Ginny. Ron had a sour look on his face.

"Making nice with snakes?" He grumbled.

Elysia rolled her eyes. "They're not all Malfoy or Parkinson."

"Millicent Bulstrode's positively sweet," Hermione agreed. 

"Didn't she put you in a headlock in second year?" Elysia asked, smirking.

"Yeah," Hermione grinned, exaggerating a dreamy sigh, at which Elysia, Luna, and Ginny all giggled.

"Seriously, those arms, though," Elysia said.

"But they're slimy Slytherins!" Ron shouted.

Ginny smacked him in the back of the head. "Grow up, Ronnikins. Besides, we've all seen you ogling Greengrass."

Ron's ears turned bright red.

### Elysium	1994/09/05 05:20

The next morning, Elysia and Hermione came downstairs for their morning run to find Luna waiting for them in the entrance hall, wearing a baby-blue velvet track-suit that matched her eyes.

"Good morning, you two," she said with her usual adorable yawn.

"Good morning, Luna!" Elysia and Hermione chorused, giggling.

They all trooped out to the shore of the lake, where Elysia led them in a quick warm-up, and then off they jogged for a lap around the lake.

Afterward, Elysia led them up to the Gryffindor fifth-year girls' dorm and down into her trunk. Luna's eyes grew as wide as Hermione's had when she'd first visited, and Elysia made sure to leave the locus room for last again.

"Ellie, this is amazing!" Luna gushed, flitting around the room and examining the rune-work.

"Thanks," Elysia said. "It's my grandmother's work. The modular locus pedestal was her last big breakthrough before she passed, according to her journals. I got to check out my grandparents' old farm over the summer, and there's an entire building built like this there."

"Elysia carved the control stone here," Hermione added.

Luna's eyes narrowed and she stared at Elysia. "These runes are well beyond intro material. There's something _off_ about you, Ellie. What are you hiding?"

Elysia locked eyes with Hermione for a moment. _I know it's only been a week or so, but I want to tell her everything. What do you think?_

Hermione wrinkled her nose. _I say do it. I like her, we both do, and I want her to trust you like I do._

_Do I detect a bit of a crush, Miss Granger?_

_Prat. Like you don't?_

Elysia mentally stuck her tongue out. Hermione responded in kind.

"Luna," Elysia said finally, "let's go to the training room and I'll explain everything."

"Alright," Luna said, leading the way.

They settled into comfortable positions on the mat.

"You're not a time traveler or something, are you?" Luna asked, cocking one eyebrow.

"Not exactly?" Elysia said. "How's your mind magic?"

"Developed, why?" Luna said, making Hermione's jaw drop.

"Wait, what? You know occlumency already?" Hermione gasped.

"Enough. A bit of legilimency too," Luna said. "Mum taught me a bit when my magic first started to show; it's useful for dueling, so she was quite good at it. It's helpful for learning faster, too."

"It is, at that," Elysia agreed. "But fully-developed mind magic is more than just occlumency and legilimency.  Everyone join hands, and Luna, cast legilimency on me."

"Alright," Luna agreed. "But this better lead to some answers!"



+++++



The three of them appeared in Elysium's sunken living area, sharing one of the squashy sofas and still holding hands. Luna looked around with interest.

"You've certainly got some nice houses, Elysia," she said. "Where are we?"

"Welcome to Elysium, my mindscape," Elysia said. "It's a replica of my residence in the after-life."

Luna cocked an eyebrow.

"Long story short," Elysia continued, "I've apparently died a bunch of times, but kept getting sent back to try again because Destiny or something. Anyway, this last time around, Eleanor was there instead of some guy named Michael, who's apparently the usual person in charge of my neighborhood of the afterlife, and Eleanor decided that, since I wasn't allowed to remember my past lives, we'd just have to cheat and stuff a bunch of knowledge and training into my subconscious from the afterlife instead. Hey, Janet?"

"Hi, I'm Janet!" Janet said, suddenly appearing in one of the chairs across from the three girls. Luna jumped.

"Janet's the personification of all knowledge in the universe," Elysia confided. "Or at least, the real Janet is. This one's the personification of all knowledge in my head."

"Close enough," Janet said brightly.

"Anyway, I don't get to remember the afterlife so much, as it turns out. Just the knowledge and training parts, and to pull them into my consciousness there's a library that unlocks them."

"A library?" Luna squealed, making Hermione giggle. "Can we see it? Can I read some of the books?"

Elysia grinned. "You and Hermione, I swear. She reacted almost exactly the same way when I first brought her here over the weekend. Come on, then. Don't overdo it, or you'll be bored silly with Hogwarts classes, but Janet put together a good list."

The girls dove in, with Luna devouring the same reading list as Hermione, and Hermione finishing the list off except for the books on Metamorphmagi and Shifting, which neither girl could make use of without already having latent metamorphmagus abilities already.

Elysia relaxed with some stories about curse-breaking expeditions, as she was still excited about their 'Curse-Breaking 101' class the day before. When they were done, they all adjourned to the trunk's training room to continue their workout.

### Hogwarts, DADA Classroom	1994/09/08 13:00

Rapidly-growing friendship between the girls aside, classes proceeded more or less uneventfully. Potions was much better now that she and Snape were on better terms; even Neville seemed to be having an easier time of things. Arithmancy was fascinating, especially with both Hermione and Luna there with her. Runes, or 'Curse-Breaking 101,' as they all called it now, was rapidly becoming all three girls' favorite class, with Hermione in particular taking to it like she was born for it.

Finally, Thursday rolled around, and with it the first Defense Against the Dark Arts class of the year.

"Constant vigilance!" Janet whispered in the back of Elysia's mind as she approached the classroom.

_Is this going to be another one of those years where the Defense professor tries to kill me?_ Elysia mused. _Lovely._ She set her glasses to active scan as she entered, noting that while Professor Moody was not visible, there _was_ a blob of magic in the back corner of the classroom that was identified as a disillusionment charm. She took a desk in front, conjured a sandstone ball, quickly carved runes for an area-effect flash-bang stunner on a command-word trigger, then over-charged it.

The other students made their way in and took their seats, wondering where Professor Moody was. And then, as the clock ticked over and class began, spell-fire came from the corner. Several students screamed, and many fell to stunners. Elysia promptly hit the deck and rolled the marble towards the corner, casting a quick shield, shifting her ears closed, and shutting her eyes. 

"Boom!" She yelled, triggering her make-shift grenade. There was a blinding flash of light, even through her closed eyelids, and she felt the wash of the pressure wave from the explosion. A crimson wave of stunning magic followed, crackling against her shield as she stood, unsealing her ears and opening her eyes.

The entire class was lying on the floor, stunned, as was the disillusioned lump in the corner. Elysia _reenervated_ Hermione, asking her to revive the rest. She made her way to the corner, casting a quick _finite_ to reveal the still-stunned Professor Moody. 

"What have we here?" She mused aloud. A quick search-and-seizure revealed the professor's wand, two spares, an enchanted flask, a couple of nondescript portkeys, and a collapsible metal baton, all of which she promptly confiscated. She then levitated the erstwhile professor to a chair, bound him with _incarcerous,_ and threw in a _petrificus totalis_ for good measure.

"Someone fetch Professor McGonagall, please," she called behind her.

"I'll go, Ellie," Neville said, suiting action to words.

"Everybody okay?" Elysia asked, as Neville exited stage left.

"I think so," Hermione responded. "Ellie, what happened? The last thing I remember was you yelling 'boom' and everything went white."

Elysia knelt and picked up her sandstone ball, which promptly disintegrated into a handful of sand as she stood. "A little something I found in a curse-breaking adventure story - a flash-bang stunner. With the twins constantly repeating 'constant vigilance' after their first Defense class, I figured something was up. And there's not a whole lot who can block an area stunner after a flash-bang breaks their focus."

"How'd you carve one so fast?" Hermione demanded.

"Who says I did?" Elysia said, winking. Over legilimency, she added, _I shifted my palm into a mirror-image etching plate of the runes and pressed them into place._

Hermione nodded in understanding. 

Neville returned with Professor McGonagall, who was looking as stern as ever.

"Miss Potter," she said, "why, perchance, do you have Professor Moody unconscious and tied up at wand-point?"

"Because he attacked us, Professor," she answered sedately.

"What?" Professor McGonagall gasped.

"It's true, Professor," Hermione chimed in. "He was disillusioned at the back of the classroom, and when class started he began firing stunners at us until Elysia stunned him."

Professor McGonagall pinched the bridge of her nose. "Really, Albus?" She muttered under her breath. "_Reenervate,_" she intoned, rousing Professor Moody, who, still under the body-bind, could only blink. "Miss Potter?" She queried. "What _else_ did you do to him?"

"Aside from the stunner and the _incarcerous?_" She replied innocently. "Just a simple body-bind. Better safe than sorry, right, Professor?"

Professor McGonagall waved her wand again, and as the body-bind lifted Moody roared with laughter. "Well done, Miss... Potter, was it?"

Elysia nodded.

"Any relation to the illustrious Boy-Who-Lived?"

Elysia's hazel eyes narrowed as she lied through her teeth. "I'm from Canada. D'you have any idea how common the surname 'Potter' is in the mundane world?"

Moody shrugged. "Fair enough, lass."

"But-" Ron said, before Hermione elbowed him with a channeled silencer.

"Alastor," Professor McGonagall cut in. "What have I told you about casting spells at students?"

"That it's not an appropriate teaching method," Moody replied. "But they've got to know what's out there. They've got to be ready. CONSTANT VIGILANCE!" He suddenly shouted, making everyone jump. "And Albus agrees. Besides," he added with a grin at Elysia, "Miss Potter here got the jump on me. Twenty points, lass. What was that, anyway?"

"A wide-area stunner," Elysia shrugged.

"'Boom' isn't the incantation for any stunner _I_ know of, lass," Moody said.

"Who said that was the incantation?" Elysia smirked. "If I yell 'boom,' are you going to hear me mutter _stupefacio locus_ right after?"

Hermione snorted.

"Another five points, Miss Potter, that's clever thinking. Now let me up so we can get on with the lesson."




+++++



Professor McGonagall decided to stay and observe the class. Once the students had retaken their seats, Professor Moody pulled out a jar of spiders, causing Ron to wince.

"Now then," Moody said, "you lot have had quite the dog's breakfast for instruction in this class, and I've only got the one year to fix what I can. As such," he growled, "best start thinking of this class as Junior Auror boot camp. The headmaster has given me quite a bit of leeway in order to bring you all up to scratch, and that includes showing you some of what a dark wizard is capable of. Which brings us to today's lesson: the Unforgivable Curses."

Professor McGonagall narrowed her eyes.

"Who can tell me the name of one of these curses?" Moody continued.

Ron raised his hand, Hermione's silencing spell long since dispelled. "The Imperius?"

Moody nodded at him. "Aye, that'd be one. Five points. Weasley, right? Your da would know all about that one, lad. Gave the Ministry no end of trouble during the war." He stunned a spider from the jar, laying it on his desk. "Needs to be a bit bigger so you lot can all see. _Engorgio!_"

The spider grew to the size of a small dog, causing Ron to whimper.

"The Imperius curse allows the caster to completely control the target," Moody lectured. "Like so. _Imperio!_"

There was no visible glow of spell-fire. There was no visible indication at all (aside from the HUD in Elysia's glasses, which were still on active-scan mode), until the spider began to tap-dance around the desk. Many of the class laughed at its antics, until Moody continued.

"Think it's funny, do you? What if I made it bite one of you?" He glowered. "Imagine this cast on your mother. I could make her kill her entire family and then herself. I could make her wander into the Ministry and assassinate people. I could make her wander out into Muggle London and blow the Statute of Secrecy wide open." The class sobered immediately.

"I think you lot get the idea," Moody said. "Anyone else thought of another yet?"

Neville raised a hand.

"You'd be Longbottom?"

Neville nodded.

"Go ahead, lad."

Neville flinched. "Th-the Cruciatus curse," He stuttered.

Moody's mundane eye softened. "Brave lad, bringing that one up. Pain beyond the tolerance of the mortal mind. Five points to you. Brace yourselves, class. _Crucio!_"

An angry blood-red beam flew from his wand. The spider rolled onto its back atop the desk, all eight legs flailing in a grotesque mockery of its earlier dance. A high keening could be heard, which was surprising -- Elysia hadn't thought spiders _could_ scream.

Elysia glanced at Neville as Moody let up on the curse, and saw tears streaking his face. She reached over and squeezed his hand consolingly.

"Sorry, lad," Moody said. "But you've got to know. Now, one left. Anyone? Miss Granger?"

Hermione put her hand down and said quietly, "the killing curse."

"Aye, lass. Five points. The killing curse means instant death. Only one person has ever survived it, so the rumor goes. Personally, I think that's rubbish and something else happened that Samhain night, but good luck convincing Albus of anything once he's made his mind up. Anyway. _Avada kedavra!_"

A sickly green bolt of spell-fire hit the spider, which curled up dead. Elysia felt as if a great, intangible _something_ had passed before her, and the weight of it chilled her to the core.

"Now," Moody said, breaking the shaken reverie of the students. "Who can tell me _why_ these spells are considered Unforgivable? You can kill someone with a simple cutting curse, cause pain with a well-placed boil hex, and control someone with judicious use of Confundus charms. What makes these three so special?"

"'Cuz using one's a one-way ticket to Azkaban," Seamus volunteered.

"Wrong, lad," Moody retorted. "You've got your cause and effect backwards. And for the record, it's only illegal to cast them on _humans._ Spiders, for instance, are fair game."

"Because you have to _mean_ them," Elysia said.

"There, that's it!" Moody enthused. "Five more points, Miss Potter. You have to mean them. I'd wager any one of you lot could throw a killing curse at me right now and I wouldn't get so much as a nosebleed. To properly cast the Unforgivables, you have to _want_ to destroy someone, with all your will. Some argue that there may be benevolent uses for these curses -- mercy killings, teaching muscle memory via Imperius, restarting a stalled heart via Cruciatus. Rubbish, I say. Not with the emotions that power them."

"You must hate spiders even more than Ron does," Seamus joked weakly. Dean reached over and smacked him upside the head.

"Back during the war," Moody continued, ignoring Seamus' outburst, "the Ministry granted special dispensation for aurors to cast the Unforgivables. Why was this a bad idea?"

Hermione raised her hand. "Because the kind of people who can effectively use the Unforgivables make for questionable officers of the law, at best."

"Dead on, Miss Granger, take five more points. The auror corps was desperate back then, but even so. There was a marked decline after the war in the quality of auror you saw in the corps. 'Course, that could've just been down to my retiring," he joked.

Professor McGonagall snorted, reminding them all of her presence.

"Thank you, Alastor, for that enlightening lesson," she said. "I believe I shall take my leave."



+++++



After class, Moody led a still-shaken Neville to his office with promises of a book on exotic plants to help soothe his nerves. The others headed back to the Great Hall for dinner.

"Why'd you lie earlier, Ellie?" Ron asked.

Elysia shot him a look and quickly cast a privacy paling around them. "You mean about being from Canada?" Ron nodded. "Same reason I changed my eye color and hid my scar. I'm bloody sick of being singled out over that bloody 'Boy-Who-Lived' shite."

"Girl-Who-Lived now, I reckon," Ron said.

"Whatever," Elysia retorted. "And besides, every DADA professor so far has tried to kill me. Even Professor Lupin last year, when he forgot his Wolfsbane. I just plain don't trust Moody. And why would _you?_ Didn't he turn you into a weasel?"

Hermione giggled.

Ron glared. "I'm never going to live that down, am I?"

Elysia and Hermione locked eyes, looked back at Ron, and shook their heads, grinning.

Ron just stalked away, grumbling.



+++++



After her spur-of-the-moment lie to Moody, Elysia decided she should shore up her story just in case. So that weekend she dropped into her library in Elysium to do some reading.

> To Do:
>
> - [x] Read up on Canada and get the story straight
> - [x] Find and read Magician, Heal Thyself
> - [x] Find and read Rock Out and Rule the Dance Floor

In the end, she decided that her cover identity was from Edmonton, Alberta, Canada, born to a pair of Muggle-born curse-breakers named David and Amelíe, and home-schooled once she was old enough to accompany her parents on expeditions. As luck would have it, snowy owls (ie. Hedwig) just so happened to be native to that area. She'd just have to avoid calling her familiar by name for awhile.

Given how intense DADA had been so far this year, she also decided to learn some healing magic. Even though she could shift most of her own injuries away, there was always a chance something could get through. Not to mention, this way she could take care of her friends.

And finally, since Hermione's birthday party was fast approaching, she decided it was high time she learned to dance. She wiggled happily in her seat in anticipation.



+++++



Later that day, Elysia was leaving the loo to rejoin Luna and Hermione in the library when a voice called out, "Harry! A word, please!" She ignored it and kept walking, but the voice called out again, "Mr. Potter! A word, if you please!" She recognized that voice. It was Dumbledore. And the irritating old goat was dead-naming her! Not even breaking stride, she continued ignoring him.

Then a hand on her shoulder stopped her and spun her around to face the headmaster. "Harry! I'm talking to you!"

"You must have me confused for someone else, sir," Elysia said stiffly. "My name is _Elysia,_ not Harry. Nor am I a 'mister.'"

"Come now, Harry," Dumbledore said, eyes twinkling in such a way that Elysia was tempted to lock eyes and shift in a basilisk stare. "We both know there are no other Potters."

Elysia's glare sharpened to a knife-edge. "You are mistaken, _sir,_" she bit out. "I'm from _Canada._ There are _tons_ of Potters out there, especially in the mundane world. I'd've expected the Supreme Mugwump of the ICW, of all people, to know that. And _furthermore,_ do I _look_ like your silly little Golden Boy? Last I heard, _he_ had green eyes and a great big scar on his forehead. I have neither. Not to mention, _I'm a girl._"

"Glamour charms," Dumbledore said dismissively.

"Go ahead then," Elysia challenged, eyes blazing. "_Finite_ them, if you're so certain."

Dumbledore drew his wand and waved it, intoning a firm, "_finite incantatem,_" and was utterly perplexed when nothing happened.

"Satisfied?" Elysia growled. "Good. Now if you'll excuse me, I have a letter to write to my parents. If this is how you treat your students, then I might just go back to home-schooling, no matter how boring things are with my parents not on expedition."

She spun on her heels and stalked off, leaving a bewildered Dumbledore in her wake.



## Chapter 12: The Best Present

### Hogwarts, Deputy Headmistress' Office	1994/09/10 15:42

After her encounter with Dumbledore, a fuming Elysia immediately sought out her Head of House.

"What's got you so furious, Miss Potter?" Professor McGonagall asked.

"That -- that sanctimonious old _goat_ just deadnamed me!" Elysia growled. She then told Professor McGonagall all about how the headmaster had accosted her in the halls, and how she'd responded. "Muggle make-up and colored contacts, of course," she lied -- this particular lie was second-nature by now; she'd have to practice actually shifting or conjuring those surreptitiously, just in case -- "but the _nerve_ of that man! I've half a mind to fake my own death at this rate!"

Professor McGonagall's nostrils flared. "I quite agree, Miss Potter," she said. "Albus has always been prone to taking far more liberties than he ought, where you're concerned. Why, just look at how he left you with those horrible relatives of yours! Faking one's death is rather a drastic measure, but I do believe I can do something about your school records, at least." She sighed. "I hate to resort to gas-lighting, I really do, but he's clearly not about to listen to reason."

"Thank you, professor," Elysia said. "And I am sorry to have dragged you into such a prickly situation, but I just didn't know who else to turn to."

"Don't you worry about that, Miss Potter," Professor McGonagall admonished. "I'm your Head of House. You're _supposed_ to be able to come to me with your troubles."



+++++

### Hogwarts, DADA Classroom	1994/09/15 13:00

The rest of September was marked by three events in particular. The first was that, a week after Professor Moody demonstrated all three Unforgivables, he informed them that Headmaster Dumbledore had granted permission for them all to be put under the Imperius curse, "so you can know what it feels like," Moody said. He'd then had them all line up, and, one by one, made them do absurd and impossible things. Neville, for instance, had performed a flawless double back-flip off of Moody's desk.

Hermione, on the other hand, merely cocked an eyebrow, sat primly back in her seat, and smirked.

When it was Elysia's turn, Moody waved his wand and a feeling like floating in the _best bubble bath ever_ drifted over her mind for a moment, before fading away like morning fog.

"Jump on the desk," Moody commanded.

"Weren't you supposed to cast the spell first, Professor?" She responded, cocking one eyebrow.

"What? But I- _Imperio!_" He cast again.

The floating feeling swept over her again, disappearing just as quickly.

"Jump on the desk."

"Is there something wrong with your wand, Professor?" Elysia asked, feigning confusion.

"Let's find out, shall we, lass? Mr. Thomas! Front and center!"

Dean came up to the front of the class, whereupon Professor Moody made him pirouette _en pointe_ like a ballerina.

"Huh. Guess it's not the wand," Elysia observed, trying not to smirk.

"So it seems," Moody agreed. "Well done, lass! Ten points to Gryffindor. And five _from_ for your cheek."



+++++

### Room of Requirement, Hogwarts	1994/09/18 12:00	

The second marked event of September was Sunday the 18th, the day before Hermione's 15th birthday, and the day Elysia had organized for her birthday party. At noon, after a somewhat longer training session than usual, Elysia, Hermione, and Luna met all their friends in the entrance hall -- the Curse-Breaking 101 girls, the Weasleys, the Chasers, Neville, and the rest of the Gryffindor fourth-year girls, with whom Hermione's relationship had improved significantly after Elysia joined them. Parvati brought her sister Padma along as well.

They were all dressed casually for the day. Elysia had on a red sundress with her Ironbelly-hide boots and jacket, and she'd taken the time to apply eyeliner and lip gloss. And judging from the glances both Hermione and Luna had been stealing, it was a good look on her.

Luna was in an airy floral-pattern dress with a pale blue cardigan, which had Elysia stealing a few glances herself. Hermione was the only one not wearing a dress; she'd donned figure-hugging jeans and a gauzy white blouse over a lime-green cami, which set off her darker complexion and kept causing the other girls to almost walk into things.

"Damn, Potter, you femme up nice!" Millicent Bulstrode said as they arrived.

"Thanks, Millie," Elysia said, giving her friend a once-over and biting her lip. Mille was in jeans, Doc Martens, a black vest tight enough to be painted on (and revealing washboard abs even through the material), and an open plaid button-up in Slytherin colors with the sleeves rolled up to show off her impressive biceps. "You look pretty damn good yourself."

"Hey there, Heart-Breaker," Parvati greeted her. "Save it for the party. Hullo, Hermione, and happy birthday!"

They all trooped up to the Room of Requirement, which Robbie had commandeered earlier. He was waiting for them in a twenty-something version of his human form, flopped on a sofa in what looked for all the world like a basement game room in a large muggle home. There were several table games -- ping-pong, foosball, billiards -- and a wet-bar along one wall covered in food and drinks. Another corner had a few arcade cabinets and a pinball table (titled, appropriately enough, _Pinball Wizard_). Along the back were more sofas, over-sized bean-bags, floor pillows, and a big-screen TV and VCR. There was a stereo behind the bar, and enough room to dance, errant billiard cues aside.

"Sweet Morgana!" Hermione gasped. "Is that _pepperoni pizza?_ Robbie, you've outdone yourself!"

"I also picked up a few movies," Robbie said, hopping up off the sofa. "_The Princess Bride, Star Wars, Raiders of the Lost Ark, Superman, Aladdin, The Goonies,_ a few Monty Python flicks..."

Hermione squealed, and bounded over to hug Robbie.

_Why the older look, bro?_ Elysia asked over their bond.

Robbie smirked. _It's closer to my actual age,_ he replied. _Besides, it makes it more awkward for any of your friends to hit on me._ 

_Oh right, good point. Sometimes I forget girls who like boys exist._

_Or the boys themselves, though aside from Ickle Ronnikins, bi disaster, I don't think it'd matter._

Elysia snorted at that.

_Besides,_ Robbie finished, _this way you can claim adult supervision._ "Alright, you lot," Robbie called out loud. "Presents first, then I'll show you pure-bloods what video games are."



+++++



Presents were a huge success. Most of them were books, of course; Hermione's reputation preceded her. But Luna had gotten her a set of exotic carving substrates and a top-tier rune-etching kit, which came in a moke-skin pouch and paired perfectly with the curse-breaker's goggles and linked runestone amulet from Elysia.

"It's got a bunch of settings built in: mage-sight augmentation, thaumic analysis, heat and X-ray vision..."

"Ooh!" Hermione's eyes gleamed.

"And the amulet -- I know it looks like a book-shaped locket," Elysia continued, "but if you open the latch and tap it with your wand, it grows into a bunch of pages of carving substrate. The first page is already linked to the goggles, too, so you can add functions. It's kind of like mine, but fancier." She held up her own amulet, which was a wire-wrapped crystal with tiny glowing runes carved into it. "And you should be able to add some of the substrates Luna gave you to it, too!"

Hermione immediately put on the goggles, sliding them up to her forehead so they held her hair back like an Alice band. She slipped the moke-skin pouch and the book-amulet on as well.

"Oh my," Luna murmured, blushing. "Don't you look dashing."

"You really do," Elysia agreed. She caught Luna's eyes. _Do I detect a crush, Luna?_

_Oh, hush, you. All three of us are crushing on each other and you know it._

Elysia mentally stuck her tongue out.

_You still haven't told me what you plan on doing with that, you know,_ Luna teased.

Elysia blushed, but gamely responded with, _wrestling yours into submission, maybe?_

Luna blushed again, and Hermione cut in with, _you two shameless flirts_ do _know that you're broadcasting, right? I heard every last word._ Hermione smirked. _Guess I'll take winner in your little wrestling match._ The other two girls' eyes widened and they flushed profusely. 

Someone had started music playing, and Robbie was currently showing the Weasley boys _Street Fighter II._ Everyone else seemed to be occupied with various games, or dancing, or talking in small groups.

"Right, you two, we clearly need to talk," Elysia muttered, dragging them over to an empty sofa and casting a privacy paling.

"Please don't make me choose," Luna said.

"Wasn't going to," Elysia said. "Janet told me about something called polyamoury. We could just all date each other!"

"Like, oh, what's the word? A triad?" Hermione said from the middle, wrapping an arm around each other girl and pulling them in to snuggle.

"Yeah, that's the word! What do you both think?"

"Yes, please!" Luna said, snuggling closer and reaching for Elysia's hand over Hermione.

Elysia grabbed her hand and snuggled closer to Hermione as well. "Hermione?"

"Well," Hermione said. "I think it's obvious that I'm all for this. But it _will_ be a bit more complicated to make things work, I'm sure."

"But we will," Elysia said. "Think I might go a bit crazy if we didn't, quite honestly."

"Me too," Luna said.

"Me three," Hermione added. "Goodness! _Two_ girlfriends for my birthday? Best day ever."

Luna giggled. "We should try kissing. Like, all three of us at once."

They all leaned into a point between them and touched lips. It was gentle and silly and Elysia's heart fluttered fit to burst. Giggling, they all settled back into the sofa and Elysia dispelled the paling.

"You three finally make it official?"

Elysia sat up, looking around to find Millie flanked by Lisa and Megan, and all three grinning.

"Mm-hmm!" Luna nodded. Hermione wore a smugly contented smile.

"I must say," Lisa said, "you certainly moved faster on things than we did. Took us most of last year to sort ourselves out. You three have been inseparable all term!"

"What can I say?" Elysia grinned. "When you click, you click! And after the summer I had, I for one am not inclined to let fear or worry or _whatever_ get in the way of enjoying life."

"Well said," Hermione chimed in.



+++++



The rest of the party passed by in a happy blur of dancing, games, and conversation. Nobody was all that surprised by the new triad, aside from Ron, who had somehow missed that the three girls always came to breakfast together.

Finally, as dinner approached, they all settled down with food to watch _The Princess Bride._ The two oversized bean-bags were taken by the two triads, and everyone was smiling contentedly when the party finally ended.



+++++

### Gryffindor Common Room, Hogwarts	1994/09/24 16:11

The third notable event of the month was arguably less positive, though some good _did_ come of it in the end. One Saturday afternoon, near the end of the month, a bemused Neville clambered through the portrait.

"Alright, Nev?" Elysia asked.

"Hey, Ellie," he said, ambling over. "I suppose so, only..." He flopped down on the sofa with a huff. "The headmaster just called me into his office, out of nowhere, for a casual chat. I'm not sure what to make of it."

Elysia furrowed her brow. "That _is_ odd."

Janet's voice popped into her mind suddenly. "Oh that scheming little-! He's hedging his bets over the prophecy," she told Elysia. "The prophecy, I might remind you, which one Sybil Trelawney _made up_ in order to try to impress Dumbledore enough to be hired as Divination professor." She relayed the words of the so-called prophecy to Elysia, who looked at Neville with a calculating gaze before casting a dizzying array of subtle privacy palings.

She then proceeded to explain about the so-called prophecy, how it could have applied to either of them at the time, how it had affected her life, and finally, that Dumbledore was most likely trying to manipulate Neville into being a 'replacement Harry' because either 'Harry' had gone AWOL or the prophecy's pronouns no longer fit.

Neville snorted, surprising Elysia. "Joke's doubly on him, then. Serves the scheming old goat right. Y'see, I'm not a bloke either."

"Wait, _what?_ You - huh. Yeah, that actually makes a lot of things make sense." Elysia mused.

"Right?" Neville said. "I tried telling Gran once, _ages_ ago, but she keeps trying to mould me into some sort of replacement for my father. You'd think that his wand not working for me would've clued her in, but no." She sighed. "I envy you, getting to transition already. Gran would _never_ give permission for the ritual, so I'm stuck waiting until I come of age. I can't wait until I can finally be Nell and don't have to be Neville anymore."

Elysia tapped her chin in thought. "Hmm. Y'know, I _might_ be able to help you out... You'll need to learn some mind magic first, though."

"What, like occlumency?" Nell said. "What's that got to do with it?"

"Because mind magic means getting to cheat at life," Elysia grinned a Marauder grin. "And I'm going to help you cheat like mad."



+++++



Other than regular movie nights and Hogsmeade triad dates, October passed relatively quietly, with few exceptions. The first was Luna's 14th birthday on the 11th.

"It's international Coming-Out Day, too," Luna told them. "Apropos, I always thought."

Another party in the Room of Requirement occurred, the weekend before, in similar vein to Hermione's. Elysia gave Luna her own set of curse-breaker's goggles and amulet, a matched set to Hermione's but trimmed in chrome instead of brass. Hermione gave her a bracelet that let her mind-speak at a distance with the other two girls as if they were using legilimency. They ended the night watching _Star Wars,_ and Luna taught everyone her lightsaber spell.

The second exception was another confrontation between Elysia and Dumbledore. She was called to his office after dinner one night, and entered to find him glaring at her over his desk.

"Did you think I wouldn't figure it out, Harry?" He said, with a look of grandfatherly disappointment.

"My name is _Elysia,_" she bit out. "Regardless of anything else, I am neither named 'Harry' nor am I a boy."

"Be that as it may," Dumbledore waved a hand dismissively. "You are still the child of James and Lily Potter, and you are from Godric's Hollow, _not_ Canada."

"Prove it," Elysia snapped.

Dumbledore gestured to one of the whirring gadgets on his desk. It had a dial on it, and the needle was pointing straight at Elysia.

"That may mean something to you, Headmaster, but you'll have to enlighten me."

"Come now, Mist -- er, _Miss_ Potter. Must you be so hostile?"

"Must you be so condescending?" She retorted.

Dumbledore sighed. "That device is keyed to your blood. It's also tied to the wards at the Dursley residence. So you see, there is no way you could be anyone _but_ Harry Potter, even if you have chosen another name. There's no running from Destiny."

"Are you speaking of prophecy, sir?"

Dumbledore's eyes widened in shock. "How do you know of the prophecy?"

"You've done little enough to earn my trust, Headmaster. I believe I'll keep that little tidbit to myself."

"Fine." Dumbledore barked. "How did you hide your eyes and your scar?"

"Make-up and tinted contacts," Elysia smirked. "You wizards never even _consider_ doing things the muggle way."

Dumbledore nodded. "I see. But _why?_ The wizarding world is not so intolerant as the muggle world about such things. Why would you hide the truth?"

"As you yourself once said, Headmaster," Elysia retorted, standing. "The truth is a beautiful and terrible thing, and should therefore be treated with great caution. If that's all, sir."

She swept out the door, leaving Dumbledore gaping behind her.



## Chapter 13: Send Lawyers, Guns, and Money

### Hogwarts	1994/10/30 16:00

At dinner on the last Saturday of October, Professor Dumbledore made the announcement that tomorrow afternoon, the 30th, the delegations from Beauxbatons and Durmstrang would be arriving in time for dinner. The school had been scrubbed from top to bottom by the house-elves, until one could practically eat off the floors. 

The next day at 16:00, all of the students were made to stand in rows, in full uniform, on the castle's front steps. Elysia was standing with Hermione and Luna, holding hands and chatting over legilimency. Their conversation was interrupted as several students pointed overhead.

"Look! Up in the sky!" Lavender yelled. 

"It's a bird!" Parvati shouted.

"It's a plane!" Colin Creevey called. 

"It's Beauxbatons!" Lee Jordan announced. 

The girls looked at each other, hummed the first few bars of the _Superman_ theme, and cracked up.

As it turned out, the Beauxbatons delegation arrived in a truly _massive_ carriage pulled by winged horses the size of elephants. It landed gracefully on the lawn, whereupon a boy jumped out and placed a set of stairs against the doors. And out stepped the largest woman any of them had ever seen.

"Ah, Dumbledore," she rumbled in a smoky, sultry voice. She floated forward as gracefully as a dancer, despite her imposing stature.

"Madame Maxime," Dumbledore greeted with a warm smile. "How lovely to see you again! I trust your journey went smoothly?"

As they spoke, students had begun piling out of the carriage. They wore sky-blue uniforms of what looked like silk, and were obviously caught off-guard by the cold of a late autumn in Scotland.

Hermione rolled her eyes at that. _Are you mages or not? Cast a warming charm!_ The other two snorted.

The Beauxbatons students all filed into the castle, following their headmistress. As they passed, something tickled at the girls' occlumency shields.

_Was that veela allure?_ Hermione asked.

_I think so,_ Elysia replied. _Hmm. I'm getting an idea..._

_You're not thinking of trying to out-allure the veela, are you?_ Luna asked, concern and amusement coloring her thoughts. _Because I don't think the school could take it._

_Well,_ now _I'm thinking about that,_ Elysia retorted. _But no, I was thinking, 'why limit aura broadcasting to just allure?'_

The other two considered that for a moment. _Elysia, love?_ Hermione said. _You're mad. Brilliant, but mad._

_We should broadcast 'silly' at dinner sometime!_ Luna giggled.

The other two cackled.

A few minutes later the Durmstrang delegation arrived, on a derelict galleon rising from the depths of the lake on a whirlpool. As the ship docked, a gangplank was lowered by hands unseen, and the students marched down, led by their headmaster. He had a goatee, close-cropped black hair with silver streaks, and an oily demeanor. Like his students, he was draped in heavy furs.

"Headmaster Dumbledore!" He cried jovially, clasping hands with him.

"Headmaster Karkaroff," Dumbledore said. "It's been quite some time."

"It has, at that," Karkaroff replied. "Would you mind terribly," he continued, "if we entered directly? Viktor here has a bit of a head-cold."

"Sweet Merlin, it's Viktor Krum!" Ron gasped, beginning to hyperventilate.

_Ronald Weasley, bi disaster,_ Elysia snarked.

_Right?_ Hermione responded.

Ginny reached over and smacked her brother. "Breathe, Ron," she murmured. "Before you make an even bigger fool of yourself."



+++++



The next morning, Janet called Elysia into the study.

"Just a heads-up," she warned. "Your name is going to come out of that goblet tonight as the fourth champion. I'd send off to a good solicitor first thing if I were you. Might I recommend Eberhardt, Bulstrode, & Tonks?"

"Good idea," Elysia replied. "I'll see if Robbie can drop by this morning."

Elysia pulled Hermione and Luna in, and they began to prepare for battle.

> To Do:
>
> - [x] Get a solicitor on retainer
> - [x] Find and read Battle Magic For The Baddest Bitches
> - [x] Find and read Magica Obscura: Shadow Magic, Bio-Alchemy, And Other 'Dark' Arts The Ministry Doesn't Want You To Know
> - [x] Find and read Curse-Breaking For Fun and Profit
> - [x] Find and read Elysia's Combat Style: Stage 4

"We've got some rituals to plan for," Elysia said. "I want to do the Unlimited Flight ritual and the metamorph ritual, at least, and then transfer the shapeshifter knowledge. I want Nell in on this, too; it'll make her life a lot easier if she can go back in the closet when her gran's around for now.

"I think Ginny should be in on them too," Luna said.

"Agreed," Hermione said.

"Alright," Elysia said. "We'll check with them and see when we can do this. The sooner the better. I have a feeling the dragon dung's about to hit the blasting curse."



+++++



Training that morning was intense, as all four of them -- the triad, plus Robbie -- pushed themselves harder than they ever had before. It got so intense, in fact, that the thaumic bleed-off warning alarm sounded.

"That's not something I ever expected to happen," Elysia said. "Now what?"

"No black holes in the house?" Hermione said. 

Luna snorted. "Bet you never thought you'd say _that,_ love."

"Too right," Hermione giggled.

"I think," said Robbie, "that I can repair the room at the Kiln, and replace this training room with a gate to there. It's got more _lignum vitae_ to work with, and I can install some grounding stones along the foundation too."

"That's brilliant, Robbie!" Hermione said.

"It is," Elysia agreed. "Just one problem: we can't legally use that property until I'm an adult."

"This tournament is supposed to be for of-age mages only, right?" Luna asked. "So what happens when your name comes out and they force you to compete?"

"By their own rules, I should be considered an adult, then," Elysia responded, thinking it through. "But that's why I'm getting a solicitor. If I'm to be stuck in this thing, I'm going to milk it for all it's worth."



+++++

### Great Hall, Hogwarts	1994/10/31 17:00	Samhain

The Goblet of Fire had been placed in the entrance hall the night before, with the headmaster's vaunted age line around it. Over the course of the day, many students had tried to place their names in the Goblet. The Durmstrang students all put theirs in as soon as they were able the night before, and the Beauxbatons students entered theirs first thing that morning. The Weasley twins spent the day sporting long white beards fit to rival Dumbledore's, which was apparently caused by trying to cross the age line while underage.

For Elysia and her friends, though, it was just another Monday. They entered the Great Hall after a thoroughly engaging class on various types of trip-wire rune schemes, which included the age line. It occurred to Elysia, though, that getting past the age line was as simple as asking someone who was of-age to enter your name for you, and said as much to the Weasley twins.

"Why didn't you just ask Angelina to put your names in?"

They both face-palmed. "Why _didn't_ we, Gred?"

"Dunno, Forge. Hey, Angelina!"

"Hey, Angelina!" Ron piped up. "Can you enter mine too?"

"That's a pretty glaring hole in the defenses, don't you think?" Hermione said.

"It is, and I wish I could say I was surprised. But after the Stone, not to mention the dog's breakfast that was security around here after Sirius escaped from Azkaban... face it, Professor Dumbledore doesn't exactly have a good track record." Elysia replied.

"Not to mention the troll in first year," Hermione said. "Sending students whose Houses are in the dungeons -- where the troll was reported -- _back_ to the dungeons, instead of simply putting the Great Hall into lockdown... what goes through that man's head I'll never know."

"And he'll never admit his mistakes unless his hand is forced, either," Luna said. "You can tell; his image is so carefully cultivated. Ooh, bouillabaisse!"

The Opening Feast that night was quite the event even for a Hogwarts feast. Aside from each school's representatives, delegates from the British Ministry were present -- Elysia recognized Ludo Bagman and Bartemius Crouch from the World Cup. And the menu was much expanded -- it featured traditional cuisine from both visiting schools' cultures (including bouillabaisse). Indeed, the house-elves had outdone themselves. Elysia was enjoying a helping of veal _kapama,_ a traditional Bulgarian stew, while Hermione was feeding Luna a bite of her _coq au vin._

"Are you finished wis ze bouillabaisse?" A voice said from behind them.

Elysia turned to find the girl who'd made her think of playing with auras the day before.

"Fine," Luna pouted playfully, in French. "I'll just have to steal more of Hermione's _coq au vin._"

"It's not stealing if I'm actively feeding you, darling," Hermione said, also in French.

"You'll have to excuse my girlfriends," Elysia finally answered the girl, opting for a distinct Quebecois accent in her French. "We're still in the 'disgustingly sappy' phase of things. I'm Elysia, and this is Hermione and Luna."

"Fleur," the girl responded.

"Charmed, I'm sure," Elysia said. "Anyway, here's the bouillabaisse -- or what's left after Luna's had her way with it, at any rate." She waved a hand lazily and floated the half-empty bowl over to a stunned Fleur.

"Did -- did you just do that without a wand?" She gasped.

Elysia laughed, and moved her left hand, which was holding her wand, out from under the table. Of course, she _had_ done it wandlessly, but Fleur didn't need to know that. "Just a bit of legerdemain," she winked.

Fleur smiled. "Of course. Thank you for the bouillabaisse." She turned and went back to her seat.

"What was that little trick about?" Luna asked.

"Just keeping the competition off balance," Elysia breezed. "Oh, that reminds me! Hey Gred! Forge! You lot still taking bets on who gets chosen?"



+++++



At last, the food was eaten, the tables cleared, and the lights dimmed. Filch brought in the Goblet, which was full of merrily-dancing blue flames. All conversation died out until it was so quiet you could hear the Goblet's fire crackle softly.

"When your name is called, please come up and exit through the door behind me," Dumbledore instructed. "Now, if I'm not mistaken, the Goblet is ready to make its decision."

The flames suddenly turned from blue to a deep red, and a slip of parchment flew out. Dumbledore snatched it from the air.

"The champion for Durmstrang is Viktor Krum!"

The room applauded as Krum stood, gave a jerky bow, and stalked out the door to the anteroom. He moved awkwardly, as if he were only ever at home on a broomstick. Elysia could relate, to some degree.

The Goblet flashed red again.

"The champion for Beauxbatons is Fleur Delacour!"

The same blonde girl from earlier stood, curtseyed to the crowd, and promenaded through the anteroom door to cheers and wolf-whistles, mostly from the boys.

The Goblet flashed red a third time.

"The champion for Hogwarts is Cedric Diggory!"

The cheers Cedric received were the loudest yet, especially from the Hufflepuff table. He stood with a grin and a wave, and followed the others to the anteroom.

"Congratulations to our three champions," Dumbledore said. "And now --"

The Goblet flashed red.

The crowd erupted in confused murmurs as Dumbledore read the slip of parchment silently.

"Miss Potter? A word, if you please," he called.

Elysia stood, confusion plastered across her face. "Headmaster?"

"To me, please," he instructed.

She joined him at the front, surreptitiously casting a wandless privacy paling. His eyes widened at that.

"It seems we have much to discuss, Miss Potter," he said.

"I'm sure we do, sir, but I don't think this is the time for most of it," she replied.

"Indeed. Miss Potter, I'll get right to it. Did you put your name in the Goblet of Fire?"

She glanced at the parchment, which read '_Harry_ Potter,' and snorted. "Of course not, sir! Aside from the fact that _my name isn't Harry,_ I have better things to do than put my life on the line for a pittance of galleons and the idle chatter of sheep."

He sighed. "Such disillusion for one so young."

She shrugged.

"In any case," he continued, "legally, your name _is_ still Harry. Let us discuss this turn of events with the rest of the Tournament officials. Please come with me to the anteroom."

"If I must," she said. "I feel I should warn you: if I am forced to compete, I shall have no choice but to involve my solicitor."

"I see," Dumbledore replied sadly. "Well, needs must. If you please," he gestured to the door.

"Something's just occurred to me," Elysia said. "This lot are all going to think I cheated my way into the Tournament. And _that's_ just not on." She dispelled the privacy paling and drew her wand.

"Elysia?" Dumbledore asked warily.

"Everyone?" Elysia said, pitching her voice to carry without need of a _sonorous_ charm. "I swear on my life and magic that I did not enter myself into this tournament, nor did I ask someone of-age to enter my name for me. So mote it be."

There was a flash, and she lit the end of her wand.

"Let's get this over with, Headmaster," she growled, and stalked through the door.



+++++



An incandescent rage was bubbling just below the surface of Elysia's stony face as she swept into the anteroom.

"Potter?" Cedric asked. "What is it?"

"Do zey want us back in ze Hall?" Fleur asked.

Viktor just cocked an eyebrow.

Elysia ignored them all. "Robbie?"

Robbie popped in. "Ellie?"

"Could you bring the solicitor, please? Things are about to get ugly."

Robbie snapped a salute and popped away, returning a few seconds later with an older woman dressed in formal robes.

"Miss Potter? I'm Andromeda Tonks," she introduced herself with a handshake.

Further discussion was interrupted as Dumbledore entered with the other Tournament officials.

"Ladies and gentlemen," Ludo Bagman crowed. "As impossible at it seems, allow me to introduce the _fourth_ Tri-Wizard Champion!" He gestured to Elysia, who growled and flared an aura of existential terror aimed squarely at him. He paled and sank into a chair with a whimper as his knees gave out.

"Not if my solicitor has anything to say about it," she spat.

"It's a binding magical contract," Crouch said flatly, to no-one in particular. "She'll lose her magic if she doesn't compete."

Elysia growled again as the room erupted in outrage. Leaning over to Andromeda, she whispered, "if you can't get me out of this, see if you can leverage it into getting me emancipated. Dumbledore's dropped the ball where I'm concerned far too often."

She tuned back into the wider conversation just as Fleur was saying, "zo zis leetle girl is to compete?"

_Little girl!?_ Elysia's already-enraged temper flared, as did an aura of sheer, overwhelming terror mixed with despairing inadequacy, directed solely at Fleur, who squeaked, flushed beet-red, and sank into a chair with wide, tear-filled eyes. _Call_ me _a little girl, will you? I could crush you like a bug and make you_ like _it. Any of us could._ Thoughts of her girlfriends swam to the fore of her mind as she began to calm down.

_Ellie, love?_ Luna asked, concern coloring her thoughts. _Are you OK?_

_Inexplicably furious,_ Elysia responded. _Not sure why; it's not like we didn't see this coming._

_Because things like this seem to always happen to you and it gets old?_ Luna replied.

_Yeah, that's probably part of it,_ Elysia said. _And also the Tournament officials are_ so _condescending!_

_We'll go blow something up in the Room of Requirement when you're done there, love,_ Luna said. _And after your oh-so-public Oath, nobody believes you cheated your way into the Tournament. Even_ Malfoy _doesn't, though he_ is _quite vocally calling Dumbledore's abilities into question._

_Wow, Malfoy and I agree on something,_ Elysia said, shocked. _Seen any pigs flying lately?_

_No, but lots of nargles and wrackspurts both._

_That's not good, is it?_

_No, probably not. Good luck, Ellie!_

_Thanks. Love you!_

_Love you too!_

Elysia tuned back in to hear the heads of the three school arguing about how it was unfair that Hogwarts had two champions. Crouch said, "It is too late. The Goblet has already gone out."

Elysia rolled her eyes. "So draw straws or something! The Goblet is obviously a bit broken, right now, so choose your second champions some other way. Honestly!"

The officials gaped at her.

"But," Bagman said, "we've only prepared for _three_ champions! Three champions, three tasks!"

"And yet here _I_ am, being forced to compete anyway," she retorted. "You would've had to rework things regardless."

"The girl has a point," Karkaroff said. "Perhaps ve could add some new tasks, as vell. Nothing so arduous as all that to organize," he temporalized. "A simple duel."

"I like zis," Maxime said. "Make it _two_ duels -- one wanded, one wizout. Zat leaves just one more task to add."

Elysia shrugged. "Seeker's duel? I know at least three of us are seekers. Fleur, do you play quidditch, by chance?"

"_Non,_" Fleur said. "But I _do_ race."

The other three champions' eyes lit up.

"That'll work," Cedric grinned.

"Well, that settles everything rather nicely," Dumbledore said.



+++++



"May I have your attention?" Dumbledore called, as everyone filed back into the Great Hall. "Due to unforeseen circumstances, each school will now have _two_ champions. The second champion for Hogwarts is Elysia Potter!"

Elysia waved shyly as the students erupted -- most cheered, though there were a few boos mixed in.

"The additional Durmstrang and Beauxbatons champions will be announced tomorrow at dinner," Dumbledore continued. "The first task, a full-contact broom race, will take place in two weeks, on Saturday the 12th, with the second task on Saturday, November the 26th. It's designed to test the champions' ability to think on their feet, so I shall say no more. And now, off to bed with you!"

Elysia reunited with her girlfriends with much hugging and kissing, until they were interrupted by Solicitor Tonks.

"May I have a word, Miss Potter?"

"Of course," she replied. "Let's find somewhere more private."

They adjourned to an unused classroom, where Hermione conjured a sofa and an armchair as Luna cast several privacy palings. They flanked Elysia on the sofa, while Mrs. Tonks took the armchair, shuffling through a briefcase for a moment.

"I confess, ma'am, that I'm in a bit of a daze," Elysia said. "How bad is it?"

"Not as bad as it could be, Miss Potter," she replied. "While, yes, you are irrevocably compelled to compete, that _does_ come with some privileges and concessions. For instance, you are now exempt from the end-of-year exams, may skip any classes you wish in order to prepare for the tasks, and are allowed a certain degree of immunity regarding interference. In short, if someone or something gets in the way of you competing, you are legally within your rights to, ahem, _handle_ it as you see fit."

The girls gasped. "Are you saying I can get away with murder?" Elysia asked.

"Well," Mrs. Tonks said hesitantly. "I would hope not _murder,_ as such, but anything short? Almost certainly."

"Well _that's_ food for thought," Hermione said.

"What's more, between that stipulation and the Ministry's -- apparently legally-binding -- rule of restricting the Tournament to only those of-age, I'm almost positive we can leverage emancipation from tonight's events."

"Excellent," Elysia said. "Can we also get my named legally changed to Elysia Lily Potter? And is there anything more you need from me tonight?"

"Certainly, and no, I don't believe I need anything more from you tonight. That Oath you swore makes my job much easier."

"Great. Then if you'll excuse us, ma'am, I need to go blow off some steam."



## Chapter 14: Ain't No Rest For The Wicked

A lot of things happened very quickly once the Goblet issue was settled, and Elysia found it hard to pay attention the next day. There had apparently been a party in the Gryffindor common room, but she'd stayed in the Room of Requirement until well past curfew with Luna and Hermione, alternately snogging and blowing things up. They finally shadow-walked back to their dorms around midnight, glad that the wards only stopped apparition.

She'd written Sirius first thing in the morning, telling him about how she'd already contacted Eberhardt, Bulstrode, & Tonks about the matter, but it looked like she was stuck competing. She embedded a password-protected portkey to the Kiln, saying that if he absolutely could not stay away, it would take him somewhere safe to stay and to call for Robbie when he arrived.

She spent History class in Elysium, plotting with Janet, Robbie, and her parents. Hermione was a bit annoyed, but understood.

"Assuming you _do_ get emancipated," Lily said, "the Kiln would make for a fantastic base of operations. There's a ritual room in the basement, right James? You could do the Unlimited Flight and Morphogenesis rituals there."

"And Sirius could stay there, too, until you catch the rat," James added. "Don't look at me like that! You _know_ he won't want to stay away once he knows you're neck-deep in it again."

"Another resource you can tap," Janet said, "is the basilisk remains. Those things won't rot for _years,_ because of the venom, so you can keep the skin for armor and sell the rest for an absolute _fortune._"

"Can't we just shift that into place instead of wearing it separately?" Elysia asked.

"You could," Janet replied, "but if it's separate, you can add enchantments. Contingency runes on the inner lining, and so forth."

"Fair enough. Robbie or I will drop in on Claymore first chance, then."



+++++



"Miss Potter," Professor McGonagall said as Transfiguration let out. "A word, please?"

"Of course, Professor," she said.

"You may stay as well, Miss Granger," McGonagall said, as the last of the students filed out. "I just want to check in with our young champion here. Now, _officially,_ I'm not allowed to help you with the tournament itself," she winked. "But then, I do believe you'll give them all a run for their money in the broom race," she smiled.

Elysia smirked. "I certainly hope so, Professor. If I'm stuck competing, I might as well take it seriously. And if I can't hold my own on a broom, I might as well forfeit and go live as a muggle right now."

"Make us proud, Miss Potter," McGonagall said.



+++++



An owl arrived over lunch from Elysia's solicitor.

> Miss Potter,
>
> As expected, it was a simple matter to confirm your emancipation, and without even needing the signature of your current guardian. We also got your name legally changed with no issues. Please sign the enclosed form (with your new name) and tap it with your wand.
>
> A pleasure working with you,
>
> Andromeda N. Tonks, Esq.

Elysia immediately read and signed the form. Once she tapped it with her wand, it disappeared with a flash. The owl had long since stolen a sausage and departed.

"It's official," she told her girlfriends. _Let's duck out and do the_ Fidelius _after Potions._

_I'll have to skip History,_ Luna said. _No great loss there._



> To Do:
>
> - [x] Take over the affairs of House Potter

+++++



"Hey, Potter," Malfoy called as Elysia approached the Potions classroom. "Scared yet? You're going to get eaten alive in the first task!"

Ron scoffed. "It's a _broom race,_ Malfoy."

Malfoy rolled his eyes. "_Obviously,_ Weasel. A _full-contact_ broom race. You know, with spells and such. One slip and BOOM! No more Potter."

Elysia laughed. "Can't get rid of me _that_ easily, Malfoy."

Millie and Tracey came up behind Malfoy. "Hey, Heart-Breaker. You good?"

Elysia sighed. "Not you too, Millie!"

Millie just laughed.

"Yeah, I'm good. Malfoy was just asking about my feelings on the race."

"That's charitable," Ron muttered.

"And trying to get a rise out of Ron," Elysia added, winking at Malfoy, who blushed. Ron, meanwhile, gaped like an affronted trout.

_Turning all Malfoy's taunting into him flirting with Ron is_ hilarious, Hermione said, cracking up over the legilimency link. _They both get so worked up about it!_

_Thing is, I think it might be true, at least a bit,_ Elysia responded.

_What, Ron and Malfoy?_ Luna chimed in from her own class. _I give it 'til end of term. Also, if Malfoy's cis I'm a crumple-horned snorkack. Even_ I _wasn't that bad at being a boy._

It was Elysia's turn to crack up.



+++++



After Potions (wherein, over legilimency, Elysia asked Snape what bits of the basilisk he wanted before it was sold off), the triad met with Robbie in Elysia's trunk. He'd already set up a gate in place of the door to the training room. They all trooped through it, and came out of what had once been a hall closet in the Kiln's farmhouse.

"Really, bro?" Elysia said. "Coming out of the closet?"

Robbie cackled.

They moved into the greatroom, which was now dust-free and partially furnished.

"Wow, Robbie, did you do all this?" Hermione asked. "This place was one giant dust bunny over the summer!"

Robbie nodded. "I figured, while I was at Gringotts getting a basilisk-harvesting team contracted, I'd grab some stuff from the vault and get this place presentable. Especially if Sirius is crashing here soon."

"How'd that go, by the way?" Elysia asked.

"Well enough. We got the flat fee, which is going to end up making us some serious coin," Robbie replied. "They'll meet us in the Entrance Hall tomorrow morning at 08:30." He shook his head. "I still can't believe you killed that thing, Ellie, much less with a bloody _sword._ I'm just glad I can watch your back properly now."

"Me too. No more sending rogue bludgers at me," Elysia grinned.

"Wouldn't work anymore anyway; you'd just disintegrate it or something."

"True, true. Well, let's get to it!"

Luna and Hermione both shifted to their animagus forms. Luna was a raven, whom Lily had named Hecate, and Hermione was a burrowing owl, whom Lily named Athena. (James was banned from naming the girls' forms, as his suggestions were unilaterally childish. "Stilts and Beaky, James? _Honestly!_ No.") Elysia joined them as Nemesis, her peregrine falcon form, and Robbie shifted into a magpie. Each grabbed a pre-carved runestone in their claws and took off for a corner of the property, settled their runestones into place, and met back at the farmhouse a scant few minutes later.

Hermione performed the ritual, making Elysia the Secret Keeper. She then promptly told the others the secret, and they trooped back into the closet and into the trunk-flat.

"We've got a couple of hours left until dinner," Luna said.

"Cuddle-pile and a movie?" Elysia suggested.

"Perfect," Hermione said.



+++++



Dinner was delayed in serving due to the announcement of the remaining two champions, much to Ron's dismay.

"The Durmstrangers all look a bit roughed-up. Think they chose theirs with a free-for-all?" Elysia mused.

"I wouldn't put it past them," Hermione said.

"The second champion for Durmstrang is Anna Kozlov!" Dumbledore announced.

A slim girl with a hard-looking face and unnaturally-straight brown hair glided up to the front. She moved like a dancer -- or a fighter. Maybe both.

"And the second champion for Beauxbatons is Izabella Maradona!"

A short, curvy girl with hair a lot like Elysia's, only with purple highlights, bounced up to the front. She beamed brightly and waved to the crowd, her violet eyes sparkling like finely-cut amethysts.

"She seems nice," Luna commented.

"As a reminder to our champions," Dumbledore continued, "the traditional Weighing of the Wands ceremony will occur this Friday afternoon after lunch here in the Great Hall, followed by a press conference and photo-shoot. And a reminder to the other students, this is a closed event. Thank you, and enjoy this delicious repast the Hogwarts house-elves have provided us!"

"Finally!" Ron said, somehow already with a mouth full of food.



+++++

### Chamber of Secrets, Hogwarts	1994/11/02 08:30

The next morning Elysia and company met the Gringotts team in the Entrance Hall.

"Ah, Miss Potter," Claymore said. "When I heard about the basilisk I just had to come see for myself."

"Good to see you, Claymore," Elysia said. "And I told you, call me Ellie. Gold still flowing, heads still rolling?"

Claymore laughed. "Always, Ellie."

Elysia introduced Claymore to everyone else, and they managed to get to Myrtle's bathroom before Dumbledore was any the wiser.

"The entrance was _here?_" Snape asked incredulously.

"Yup," Elysia replied. "Go figure, right? _Open,_" she added, in Parseltongue.

The sink swiveled out of the way, revealing the same dingy oversized pipe sloping down and out of sight.

"I mean," she continued, "I doubt it _started out_ as a ladies' loo, but then again who would ever think to look _there_ for the hidden entrance to a legendary secret chamber? _Stairs,_" she hissed, and gestured for everyone to follow.

They continued on, passing the cave-in, which Snape transfigured into something sturdier and more easily passed, and the shed skin, which the goblins promptly stuffed in a bottomless sack.

"Eep!" Luna squeaked at the sight of it. "And if that's a _shed_ skin, that means..." She paled and clung tightly to Elysia's arm. Hermione paled at her words and did the same on Elysia's other side.

Eventually they came to the doors carved with snakes, their emerald eyes glinting in the wandlight. They still lay ajar, and eerie shadows danced in the poisonous green light of magical torches.

"Honestly, Salazar," Elysia muttered. "_Working lights,_" she hissed. The room brightened considerably, and the torches changed to a neutral hue closer to daylight. "Much better."

"Holy shit," Snape breathed, as they caught sight of the slain basilisk.

"Language, Russ," Elysia sang.

"Sorry, Lily -- erm..." He replied, blushing.

Elysia cackled. "Sorry, sir, couldn't resist."

Snape snorted. "I'm sure."

"I thought I'd imagined how big it was," Ginny said softly, face pale. "I thought I'd come down and see it for real and it wouldn't look nearly so enormous. But it _does. Bigger,_ even."

"You wanna kick it?" Elysia asked.

"What?"

"Go on, kick it! Give it a good one, right in the snoot. You too, Hermione," Elysia said.

Nell giggled nervously.

"A-alright," Ginny said. She strode purposefully over to the giant snake, wound up, and let fly fit to make a star striker jealous.

"Oh my _gosh,_ that's _so_ cathartic!" She gushed. "Hermione, you've _got_ to try it!" She gave it a few more for good measure before Hermione took her place.

Hermione threw a spinning roundhouse with a channeled banisher. The giant snake, all 42 tons of it, actually slid back a bit, with a visible shock-wave rippling down its length.

"Sweet Merlin in a bucket, Hermione, you hit like a freight train!" Ginny gasped.

Hermione smiled bashfully. "I've been training with Luna and Ellie."

"How, by dead-lifting the giant squid?" Nell quipped.

"I want in," Ginny said.

"Me too," Nell agreed.

"Alright. Ron?" Elysia asked.

Ron shook his head. "Nuh-uh. I know when I'm out of my depth. 'Sides, I'm a teenage boy. I need my beauty sleep."

Hermione rolled her eyes.

Luna was wandering around looking at the Chamber. "Hey, I think this place is a ritual chamber! Or was, at any rate."

"That makes sense," Hermione said. "Isn't the Wardstone Chamber down here somewhere too?"

"I think so," Elysia said. "They both connect to the access tunnels, anyway, but then, isn't that the point of access tunnels?"

"Wardstone Chamber?" Snape asked. "What _have_ you girls been up to?"

"We were looking at that broken old lightning ward, and found out where the curse on the Defense Professorship is," Elysia said. "We looked into it. It's an ongoing project."

"Ah," Snape said faintly. "What's this about a lightning ward?"

That set Hermione off. "It turns out the reason that muggle technology _supposedly_ doesn't work at Hogwarts is because some _imbecile_ raised a generalized anti-electricity ward instead of just installing a lightning rod like a sensible person."

"Never mind that this was, of course, centuries before muggles had found a use for electricity in the first place," Snape threw in sardonically.

"Yes, well," Hermione said, biting her lip. "We fixed it."

"You _fixed_ it."

Hermione nodded, and the triad told him all about their foray via the Room of Requirement.

"So you mean to tell me," he said finally, "that a gaggle of fourth-years --"

"And third-years!" Luna piped up.

"-- snuck into the Hogwarts Wardstone Chamber, a place that is near mythical in both its protections and _mere existence,_ and _fixed_ the most intractable reason for the magical world's technological stagnation _in an afternoon?_"

They nodded cautiously.

"_You mean to tell me,_" he continued, "that you have proven conclusively that there is, in fact, a curse on the Defense Professorship, _and_ are well on the way to 'fixing' that as well?"

They nodded again.

"_You mean to tell me,_" he finished, a wide grin breaking upon his face, "that I can _finally_ get some decent music in this place?"

"Movie nights, too," Luna added happily, bouncing on her toes a bit.

"Hallelujah!" Snape cried. It was genuine, and both Ron and Nell were completely gobsmacked.

Elysia couldn't help it -- she broke down giggling, and soon everyone else joined in.



+++++



"You know," Hermione said, "we really ought to properly document this beast while we still can."

"There's always a pensieve," Elysia said. "Pretty sure you can take pictures from inside one. And the goblins can tell us its measurements."

"I guess that's good enough," Hermione said.



+++++



"I've been meaning to ask, Elysia," Snape said. "How are you handling the whole Tournament situation?"

Elysia shrugged. "Honestly, I'm resigned to it. Some good things have come from it, I guess, but I _hate_ standing out over something I had no say in."

Snape snorted. "You're a Potter. You'd stand out anyway. It's in your blood. But look at it this way: you may not have entered of your own volition, but you can compete on your terms. Own it, do the best you are able, and do it in style."

"That's a good point," Elysia said. "Hmm. Style. You've a flair for the dramatic, sir; what would _you_ do?"

"Well," Snape smirked, "as any Slytherin knows, setting the right tone is paramount. And the best way to do _that_ is with music."

"The Hat _did_ want to put me in Slytherin at first," Elysia mused. "So, what, I should play the rock star?"

"If the hype fits. You are aware, I presume, of the 'Power Walk' trope?"

"Like pro wrestlers?"

Snape nodded. "Do that. Walk in with a soundtrack, and _own_ it."

"Like you do with your classes! Do you have a song in your head when you sweep in like you do?"

"Of course! Black Sabbath's 'The Wizard,' usually, if you can believe that. It came out the year I started Hogwarts, and it always seemed to fit so well."

"Seriously?" Elysia cackled. "That's -- that's --"

"Hilarious, I know," Snape said with a Cheshire cat grin.

+++++



Eventually, the goblins didn't need them around anymore, and they tired of exploring the Chamber. They all went their separate ways, with the fourth-years making for Charms and the others their own classes. Snape swept off to teach, and now that he'd mentioned it, Elysia could match his stride to Geezer Butler's relentless rhythm as his cloak flared dramatically.

All through Charms she turned the idea over in her head. They were starting Summoning Charms, which as a staple combat spell Elysia knew backwards, forwards, upside-down, and wandless, so she was left with quite a bit of time to think. Eventually, she dropped into Elysium to talk with her parents about it.

"Padfoot and I were quite the hellions back in school," James said when she asked. "Those dragonhide boots and jackets were ours, actually. You've got mine, and Robbie's got Padfoot's. So that's a good start right there."

"They really do go with almost everything," Lily agreed.

"So I'll run with that, then. Hard-femme rocker-chic aesthetic, cocky strut, rock-star attitude. Ugh, Russ is never going to let me live that down, is he?"

Lily snorted. "Like he doesn't do the exact same thing with Sabbath? If I recall, this _was_ his idea in the first place."

"As if that'd stop him."

"So whistle the harmonica part." James said.

Lily and Elysia cracked up.

"Okay, so music, then," Elysia finally said. "I at least need a song for the Weighing of the Wands, though if we can think of a good one for the broom race too I wouldn't say no."

"What's that nickname your friends keep calling you? Heart-Breaker?" Lily asked. "Isn't that a Pat Benatar song?"

"That's perfect!" James cried.

"Ooh, I _like_ it!" Elysia said. "So what about the broom race? I'm planning to strip the limiter on my Firebolt and rig a manual activator on the windscreen charm, and use the Unlimited Flight ritual for inertial compensation. If they can catch me, they bloody well _deserve_ to win."

"It's full-contact, right?" Lily asked. "Drop a wave of stun lightning behind you as you go."

"Firebolts and lightning: very, very frightening!" James cackled.

"No, Bohemian Rhapsody's got the wrong vibe." Lily retorted.

"I rather like Judas Priest. 'Living After Midnight,' maybe?" Elysia said.

"For the walk-up, sure," Lily said. "But during the race, I'm thinking something faster. Metallica's 'Seek & Destroy?'"

"No, save that for the duels," Elysia said. "It'll have more impact once they know what I can do. For this, I want them eating my dust while their faces melt off, not shaking in their boots beforehand."

James and Lily looked at each other. "Motörhead."

"_Hell_ yes," Elysia said.



+++++



Over lunch, she had Robbie take their jackets to Madame Malkin for some custom work. When they came back the next evening, hers had 'Nemesis' embroidered across the back in glistening blood-red thread. Robbie's had 'Hermes' in a glimmering silver. She also placed an order for sets for Luna and Hermione for Yule, and got matching pairs of auror-grade mage-space wand holsters for each of them. (Robbie didn't use a wand, but the space could be used for anything, so it was still useful.)



+++++



"You lied to me, Miss Potter," Professor Moody said that Thursday as class ended. With her cover identity blown upon her selection as a champion, Elysia had long since decided to change her eyes back to her mother's vibrant green. The scar stayed gone, though.

"About being from Canada?" 

Moody nodded.

"With respect, sir," Elysia responded, "you're an unknown quantity. And Hogwarts doesn't exactly have the best track record with Defense professors. Besides," she smirked. "You bought it. Constant vigilance, Professor!"

### Great Hall, Hogwarts	1994/11/04 13:00

Finally, Friday came, and with it the Weighing of the Wands. She'd already gotten the day's assignment from Snape, and Robbie had acquired a boom-box with a 6-disc CD changer. They'd charmed it to run off of an ambient magic tap instead of batteries, since otherwise it would devour them like Ron devoured dessert, and prepped the wardrobe change in her trunk. Janet had warned her about Rita Skeeter, and Elysia had decided to see if she could be brought onside. If not, well. Who could fault someone 'accidentally' squashing a bug?

Lunch ended, and her girlfriends kissed her goodbye and wished her luck. She shadow-walked to her trunk, changed into tight jeans, a black AC/DC tee, and her dragonhide, and shadow-walked back to an empty classroom near the Great Hall. Robbie joined her, similarly-attired (with a Queen tee) and boom-box in tow. He also wore a gold pendant with the Potter crest in enamel.

The pair waited under her invisibility cloak outside the Great Hall until everyone else was inside.

"3. 2. 1. Let's jam!" Robbie said, pressing Play. Ellie Banished the doors open and sauntered in, Benatar's dulcet tones blaring as Robbie, boom-box held overhead, followed right behind her.

The effect was better than she could've hoped.

The Great Hall turned out to have downright _amazing_ acoustics, and her entrance, stately yet swaggering, drew the eye of everyone in the room and held it.

The press were eating it up -- Rita's quill was a green blur, and her photographer was clicking away like a metronome. Crouch stared stiffly ahead, while Bagman bobbed his head with a delighted smile. Karkaroff smirked. Madame Maxime grinned. Cedric's jaw was on the floor. Krum nodded appreciatively. Anna was tapping a foot, and Elysia could almost swear she saw a smile for a second. Fleur sniffed disdainfully, but was also blushing fiercely. And Izabella...

Izabella threw the horns and started dancing.

But the best reactions were Dumbledore and Ollivander. Dumbledore wore a look of shock and dismay, which almost made Elysia break stride and break down giggling. Ollivander, though, was actually playing air-guitar.

_That's one for the pensieve,_ Elysia grinned.

"Woo, _izorratu,_ now _that's_ an entrance!" Izabella said when Robbie faded the music out. "You've got _style!_ Potter, right?"

"That's right," Elysia said with a grin.

"Izabella Maradona. But you can call me Izzy."

"Call me Ellie, then. You're from Beauxbatons, yeah?"

"Yup!" She bounced a bit. "It's kinda _botika,_ but it's nice," she said _sotto voce._

"_I'm sure, if Miss Delacour is any indication,_" Elysia answered in Basque, recognizing the word '_botika_' as 'snooty'. "_Her nose gets any higher, we'll be able to see up it._"

Izzy giggled. "_We're not_ all _that bad. Wait, you speak Basque?_"

"_It turns out my family has roots there,_" Elysia answered. "_Way,_ way _back, like over a millennium, we were known as Eltzegilea. Not sure when we ended up in England, come to think of it. I picked up the language over the summer so I could read the older family records._"

"_Hem, hem,_" Dumbledore interjected. "Now that our final champion has arrived, perhaps we can get started?"

Elysia rolled her eyes. "I walked in not 30 seconds after Cedric."

"Yes, well." Dumbledore said, looking uncomfortable. "Master Ollivander, if you would?"

Ollivander bowed. "Certainly, Headmaster. Miss Kozlov, you first."

Anna prowled over and handed Ollivander her wand. He started as it touched his hand, and he peered closely at it. 

"Oh my. Prickly ash, quite solid. Just shy of 11^7/10^ inches. And..." His eyes widened. "_Thestral sinew?_ I hadn't realized Gregorovitch had expanded his repertoire so." He waved the wand, and a blossom of silver fire erupted from the tip, accompanied by the tinkling of tiny bells. "Lovely."

Anna bobbed a curtsey as she took her wand and stepped back.

"Miss Delacour?"

Fleur stepped forward and handed over her wand.

"Hmm, yes. Rosewood, 9^1/2^ inches, inflexible, containing... dear me."

"An 'air from ze 'head of my grandmuzzair, a full-blooded veela," Fleur finished.

"Quite. I've never used veela hair myself, of course. I find it to be rather temperamental, but I imagine it _would_ suit you given the family relation. Lovely workmanship as well. Beauvais family?"

Fleur nodded. "Valentina."

Ollivander waved the wand, and with a muttered spell a bouquet of roses sprouted from the end. He handed both the bouquet and the wand to Fleur, who took them and stepped back.

"Mister Diggory!" Ollivander called.

Cedric stepped forward and offered up his wand.

"Ah, one of my own creations," Ollivander said with a smile. "Ash, and a tail-hair from a particularly statuesque unicorn stallion. 12^1/4^ inches, pleasantly springy, and in fine condition. You treat it regularly?"

Cedric grinned. "Polished it last night!"

Elysia snorted. "I bet you did."

Izzy stifled a giggle.

Cedric blushed at his accidental double-entendre. 

Ollivander rescued him by waving the wand, sending a stream of silver smoke rings puffing around the group before handing it back.

"Mister Krum, if you would?"

Krum slouched forward and thrust his wand into Ollivander's hand, then stood scowling with his hands in his pockets.

"Ah, another Gregorovich creation!" He pronounced. "Hornbeam, 10^1/4^ inches, and... hmm, yes... dragon heart-string, quite rigid, rather thicker than one usually sees. _Avis!_" With a loud _bang,_ a flock of small birds appeared and flew out the owl-doors in the eaves. He returned the wand to Krum, and the boy slouched back.

"Only our two youngest champions left," Ollivander rubbed his hands excitedly. "Miss Maradona, if you please?"

Izzy bounded over and handed over her wand, bouncing on her toes as Ollivander examined it.

"Now _this_ is unusual," he exclaimed. "A Quintana family creation; it has similar embellishment to old Thiago's work. Tomás, perhaps? I haven't seen the like in quite some time. Black walnut, 11 inches, and surprisingly bendy. And... goodness me. Is that a _matagot whisker_ for a core?"

"Yup!" Izzy said.

"How apropos," Ollivander said faintly. He swished the wand, sending a stream of opalescent bubbles spewing forth. As they popped, faint giggling could be heard. He handed the wand back, and Izzy hopped back.

"And last, but certainly not least," Ollivander said. "Miss Potter!"

Elysia popped her wand from its holster, flipped it around her index finger like a knife, and extended it to Ollivander handle-first.

"Yes, how well I remember. Holly, 11 inches, quite supple, and with a feather from a particularly fine phoenix."

Elysia grinned. "I'll pass on your compliments to Fawkes."

Dumbledore looked startled at that.

"Quite," Ollivander said. "For all that it's clearly well-maintained, this wand has seen some excitement, Miss Potter."

Elysia shrugged. "Some of us actually _use_ our wands," she said, with a smirk at the others. "Those acid burns, for instance: venom splash from the basilisk I slew in second year. Big one, too -- fangs the size of my arm, and the goblins said it measured 64 feet long, nearly 6 feet across, and weighed in at just shy of 42 tons. And those slight scorch marks there by the tip: an overchanneled _Patronus_ charm last June. Ran off the entire cohort of dementors the Ministry had guarding against Sirius Black -- something like a hundred of the cursed things -- when they swarmed my friends and I. And that off-color streak there: when we took out a troll in first year."

The others were gaping. Dumbledore just hung his head, pinching the bridge of his nose.

"I've always felt that a wand is like a _judoka's_ belt," Elysia continued. "The wear is a record and a reminder of what you've gone through to get where you are. Like scars. I look at mine and think, _I'm still alive. Look what I survived._" She shrugged. "I mean, it's either that or go a bit mad, yeah?"

"_Izorratu,_" Izzy breathed.

"And yet, you hide your most distinctive scar," Rita finally piped up. "Why is that, Elysia -- can I call you Elysia?"

"I didn't _earn_ that one, Rita -- can I call you Rita?" Elysia said. "Let's talk after, and I'll tell you what _really_ happened there. Anyway, it's been nothing but trouble, so I had it removed the muggle way a few days ago. It's been hidden with make-up before that." _Damn, I'm getting a bit too good at lying through my teeth._ C'est la vie.

"I find it hard to believe such outlandish tales," Karkaroff scoffed. "You are but a child."

Elysia crossed her arms. "I can show you some memories, if you insist. Actually, yeah, let's do that. Robbie? The pensieve, please."

Robbie popped away and came back a second later, setting the Potter pensieve on the staff table.

"Miss Potter," Ollivander said. "Can you truly cast a corporeal _Patronus?_"

She simply held out her hand for her wand. Ollivander handed it back, and she waved everyone out of the way as she faced the center of the Great Hall.

"_Expecto patronum!_" She proclaimed, thoughts full of Hermione and Luna.

An enormous silvery bird exploded out of her wand, glowing like the sun. Its wingspan was nearly as long as one of the House tables.

"Huh. _That's_ different," She said casually. "It was a stag last June. And not nearly so big."

"_Яички Распутина (yaichki rasputina),_" Anna breathed.

"My word," Ollivander exclaimed. "A thunderbird! How fabulous!"

"Extraordinary!" Madame Maxime said.

Karkaroff simply glared.

Rita looked like Yule had come early, and her photographer was clicking away like a rabid Geiger counter.

"I take it we've moved on to the 'press conference' portion of the program?" Bagman asked.

Elysia moved over to Rita Skeeter, casting a surreptitious privacy paling. "Rita, I'll make a deal with you. You play by my rules, and you get all my exclusives."

Rita narrowed her eyes. "I'm listening."

"Nothing too onerous," Elysia said. "Give the rest of the champions equal billing for the Tournament profiles, stick to the truth about me and mine -- no speculating; if something piques your interest, just ask me about it. Odds are I'll tell you, and with plenty of dirt to go with it. And in return, I tell you _all_ about the life and times of the Girl-Who-Lived, including Dumbledore's dirty little secrets. Not to mention what I've got on Fudge."

Rita's eyes gleamed. "Intriguing. But what makes you think you can dictate terms, little girl?"

Elysia's eyes narrowed. "Let's just say a little bug told me a secret of yours." She let slip a targeted aura of unease, just enough for Rita to feel that she meant business.

Rita gulped visibly. "R-right... Okay, we have a deal."

They shook on it, and Elysia dropped the paling.



+++++



After Rita grilled all six of them for what felt like hours, but was really closer to only one, they took photos. Rita and her photographer had them pose all together, on their own, and in various group permutations. Elysia's favorite was of her and Izzy playing air-guitar together with Ollivander. She got the photographer to promise to send her a copy of that one, whether it made it to press or not.

They also took a trip into the pensieve, to view carefully-selected memories of the troll-fight in first year, the basilisk in second year, and the routing of the dementors in third. They all emerged shaken, clearly seeing Elysia in a new light. Dumbledore was pale, and his face was drawn in a disturbed frown. Rita was clearly bursting with questions, but Elysia took her aside and told her to write them down and they'd meet over lunch on Sunday and do an in-depth interview -- likely the first of many -- and that seemed to satisfy her.

As they were finishing up, Robbie sidled over to mention that Sirius had arrived and called him. 

"Go, make sure he doesn't burn the place down. Take the music with you, maybe it'll distract him."

Robbie laughed. "Right-o!" He slipped the pensieve into his wand-holster pocket, grabbed the boom-box, and popped away.

_No rest for the wicked,_ Elysia thought.



## Chapter 15: Working For The Weekend

Dinner seemed to drag on forever. Elysia made sure to eat enough, because she doubted she'd get much sleep tonight. First, she had to catch Sirius up on everything -- and there was _so much!_ And then there were the two rituals, and then the knowledge transfers. If she got to bed before dawn, she'd consider it a win.

Finally, Luna, Hermione, Ginny, and Nell met up in the Gryffindor common room, while Elysia grabbed her trunk from her dorm and brought it down. Elysia placed it in an out-of-the-way corner with the strongest notice-me-not paling she could cast, and then everyone filed into the trunk flat -- where she told them the Secret -- and out to the Kiln.

Robbie had finished furnishing and stocking the farmhouse. He'd set aside the master suite for Elysia, so Sirius was set up in one of the four other bedrooms, and was currently enjoying a hot shower in one of the the hall bathrooms -- by singing along to Led Zeppelin's 'Black Dog', apparently.

"Is he--?" Hermione asked.

"Singing the most obvious song possible in the most obvious way possible? Yup!" Robbie said, greeting them as they all entered the greatroom. "At least he's on-key."

"Alright then," Elysia said. "While we're waiting around, Nell, Ginny, it's time for you to become animagi."

"What." Nell said flatly.

"Really!?" Ginny squealed.

"Sure," Elysia said. "Trust me, this is the _least_ weird part of what's going to happen tonight. Come on, get comfortable and grab my hands. _Legilimens!_"

She pulled them both into her mindscape, and got her first look at Nell as she saw herself.

"Um." Ginny said, blushing a lovely bright pink.

Nell had the same round face, with softer lines. Her dirty-blonde hair came down to her shoulder blades, and had a few streaks of darker brown which brought out her warm brown eyes. She still had her baby fat, but now it was distributed in a more curvaceous pear-shaped figure. Elysia popped a mirror in front of her.

"Is--is that _me?_" Nell asked faintly. She ran her hands over herself as if she couldn't quite believe it. "It is. _It is!_" Tears sprang to her eyes as a beatific smile lit up her face, and she lunged to Elysia and gave her a crushing hug. "Thank you," she sobbed into Elysia's shoulder.

"Don't thank me yet, Nell," Elysia said, returning the hug. "We've got a busy night ahead of us before you get to stay this way. And the sooner we do, the sooner we get to take you shopping! Come on, let's get started."

She led a tearfully-smiling Nell and a slightly dazed Ginny to the study.



+++++



### The Kiln, Red Wharf Bay, Wales, UK	1994/11/04 20:16



Elysium was a busy place that evening. First Ginny and Nell were told all about what was up with Elysia this year, and delved into Janet's reading list, particularly the animagus book. They also met James and Lily, who named their animagus forms. Ginny was a tigress, whom Lily named Durga, and Nell was a lioness, which Lily named Freya.

And then there was Sirius.

Elysia, Nell, and Ginny had just opened their eyes when Sirius walked in, still toweling his hair.

"Sirius!" Elysia cried, and pounced on him with a crushing hug.

"Pup!? Is that you?" Sirius asked as the hug broke. "Wow, you look amazing! And happy," he added. "When I got your last letter I was worried."

Elysia grinned, a bit ferally. "I'm not the one you should worry about. Everyone, the infamous Sirius Black. Siri, these are my girlfriends Hermione Granger, whom you already know, and Luna Lovegood. And then this is Ginny Weasley and Nell Longbottom."

"Nell?" Sirius' brow furrowed, then cleared. "Ah, I see. She's like you, then?"

"Yeah. Have a seat, Padfoot, it's going to be a long night. Can the rest of you start setting up for the Morphogenesis ritual? We'll be along once Sirius is caught up."

"The _what?_ Pup, what is going on here?"

"You'll see. Now sit down! Trust me, it'll be worth it."

Sirius finally settled onto the sofa as the others trooped downstairs. Elysia locked eyes with him. "_Legilimens._

"Whu--?"

They dropped into Elysium, where James pounced before Sirius could even find his footing, knocking them both to the living room floor.

"Padfoot!"

"Oof! What -- _Prongs?_" Sirius gasped. "Is it really you?" His eyes filled with tears and he hugged James tightly. 

"As close as it gets without necromancy, anyway," Lily agreed, from next to Elysia.

Sirius sat up finally, sniffling a bit. "Okay, for the umpteenth time, _what_ is going on here? Lils, is this _your_ doing?"

Lily snorted. "I wish."

Elysia cocked an eyebrow. "Why would this be Mum's doing?"

"Pup, dunno if you've noticed, but your mother is a little scary. As in, she's tiny and _eldritch._"

Lily grinned, James laughed, and Elysia looked thoughtful. 

"So _that's_ where I get it from." She grinned, matching Lily's slightly feral gleam.

Sirius stared at James. "Help me, Prongs, there's two of them!"

James cackled. "Isn't it great?"

Eventually, they managed to bring Sirius up to speed, including the Secret of the Kiln, and Elysia got him to read _Processing Trauma._ Twelve years in Azkaban left its scars, not least of all the decade-and-change of living and growing he'd missed out on. In many ways, Sirius still thought and acted like he was fresh out of his teens. But now the shadows that haunted his gaze weren't as dark or as deep, and the light in his eyes stayed brighter for longer.

Finally, Elysia and Sirius joined the others in the ritual chamber below the farmhouse.

"Alright," Elysia said, once everyone was in position. "We've got two rituals to do tonight. The first one is the Morphogenesis Ritual, which is bio-alchemy. Things are going to get a bit messy. I've already prepared the reagent. Everyone, take a sip and pass it to your left when I give the signal."

She waved a hand and the lights went out, the room now only lit by the ritual candles. The subjects of the ritual -- Hermione, Luna, Ginny, Nell, and Sirius -- stood at each point of a pentagram. Between each point was a candle, and around the pentagram was a ring of runes between two circles. 

Elysia sliced her finger, moved to the northernmost point and began pacing deasil, chanting and gesturing. As she moved, the others took up a completely different chant, and lines of light and magic began to take shape. At each point where the pentagram touched the inner circle, right behind each participant, she dripped a few drops of blood. When she had dripped at each point she shifted the wound closed, and a wall of faintly-shimmering magic enclosed the circle.

A phantom bell began to toll, and Elysia gave the signal. Hermione took a sip from the flask Elysia had given her, passing it to Luna, who passed it to Nell, then Ginny, then Sirius. The empty bottle was tucked away in a pocket.

The chanting reached a crescendo. Elysia lifted her arms high and shouted the final words. The others all threw their heads back and screamed, blood feeling as if it were on fire and the glow of magic streaming from their eyes and wide-open mouths. Finally, the magic abated and they all slumped to the ground. The phantom bell gave a final toll, and the candles blew out in an otherworldly wind.

In the pitch-black of the chamber, Elysia could hear only the gasping breath of the others. She brought the lights up slowly, and found them all sprawled on the chamber floor, wide-eyed and shaking.

"Everyone okay?" She asked, moving to help them sit up.

"Yeah," Ginny said. Her voice was rough.

Elysia floated some bottles of water to each of them, which they took gratefully and drained.

"So that's the hard part done," she said, to everyone's relief.

"Worth it," Nell said.

> To Do:

> - [x] Do the Morphogenesis bio-alchemy ritual



+++++



After a break and snacks, Elysia and Robbie gathered the components for the Unlimited Flight ritual, and they all returned to the chamber. 

Inside the rune circle, they removed the pentagram and inscribed a hexagram with a paint made from crushed eggshells. At each point, nestled upon a bed of feathers, a crystal was placed which had been charged with a single component spell of the main Unlimited Flight spell: anti-gravity, acceleration, raw velocity, inertial compensation, agility, and a triggering charm. In the center, a larger crystal was placed; it was charged with the full Unlimited Flight spell. Its feather nest was woven through with a hair from each of them.

They each sliced a finger and dripped a few drops into the rune circle. Magic flared, the lights dimmed, and they drew their wands and began chanting, "_Hegan egin mugarik gabe! Hegan egin mugarik gabe!_"

As they chanted, the central crystal floated into the air, followed by the ancillary crystals. The smaller crystals began orbiting the larger in intricate patterns, weaving in and out and leaving braided ribbons of light in their wake. Finally, the crystals orbiting so fast they could no longer be seen, there was a blast of light and magic, which buffeted the runic circle's barrier. With one final chant, they all stepped forward, breaking the barrier.

Light flared. Light filled them. They _were_ light.

They floated for a moment that lasted an eternity.

Finally, the light faded, seeping into their very beings, and they opened their eyes to find themselves floating a foot above the ground.

"Sweet _Morgana,_" Hermione gasped.

"What a _rush!_" Nell exclaimed.

Ginny just giggled euphorically.

Luna floated serenely over to Elysia and kissed her, suddenly and passionately, before doing the same to Hermione.

Sirius was crying tears of joy. "I... I haven't felt this weightless _ever,_" he sobbed. "For the first time in my life, I feel _free._"

Elysia smiled. "Not quite yet, Padfoot. First, I need to teach you all how to shape-shift. And then. Oh, _then_ you'll know true freedom."

They all ended up in the living room in Elysium, where Janet carted in a stack of books for each of them. Luna and Hermione only had the metamorphmagus and shapeshifting books, while the others had the same reading list to catch up on. Elysia spent the time going over the information on the horcruxes and plotting with her parents and Janet.

"Most of these will be pretty easy with Sirius helping," James said. "He can access the locket in Grimmauld Place, and as Lord Black he can annul Bellatrix's marriage to Rodolphus Lestrange. That triggers repayment of her dowry and reversion of all her assets, which, since the Cup is in her personal vault, means Sirius can simply walk into Gringotts and withdraw it."

"That's convenient," Elysia said.

"The Diadem you can deal with whenever," Lily said. "Might want it sooner rather than later, though. If you clear out the horcrux, its power will give you an _enormous_ edge."

"I'll probably grab it tomorrow, then," Elysia said. "I could use the help when I modify my Firebolt. The Ring is the one I'm worried about. Riddle will likely be watching the Gaunt Shack fairly closely right now."

"Worry about that when the time comes," Janet said. "Worst case, just have Robbie on standby to glass the place with Fiendfyre as soon as Riddle's in the middle of the ritual."

"That'll work," Lily said with an evil smile. "And then there's just the snake and the man himself, which should be no trouble for you in the moment."

"Awesome," Elysia said. "Well, nothing left to do but kick some arse."

Ginny and Nell both read _Processing Trauma,_ and the difference, while not as stark as with Sirius, was substantial. Nell was much more confident, especially now that she finally fit her own self-image. Ginny still had claws, but she'd lost the desperate edge and occasional spirals of despair she'd had for most of the last year.



+++++



Eventually, everyone was done reading and they all decided to go for a night flight around the grounds. As the entire property was both heavily warded and under _Fidelius,_ there was no need to worry about being seen as long as they didn't fly too high -- the wards capped at roughly a mile up.

"This is the _life,_" Sirius said, lazily floating on his back.

"Right?" Elysia said. She, Luna, and Hermione were also floating on their backs, heads together and holding hands. The moon was a waxing crescent, and so didn't wash out the stars. The night sky was cloudy, but not enough to completely block out the view, and it had been an exceptionally mild autumn thus far, so they had barely even needed warming charms.

Nell had drifted down to explore among the woods, and Ginny was performing increasingly daring aerobatic feats and having the time of her life. And Robbie, always one to stay busy, had decided to check the pond for fish.

"So, a broom race, huh, Pup?" Sirius asked.

Hermione smirked. "I know that at least three of the other champions are aces on brooms, but let's be real: Ellie's got this in the bag."

Elysia grinned devilishly. "I'm going to strip the limiter on my Firebolt. Should break the sound barrier in two to three seconds, and top out around Mach 1.8."

Sirius' eyes widened and he bounced a few feet higher up. "Sweet Merlin!"

Luna giggled. "You _do_ know we can go much faster _without_ a broom, now?"

"Just remember to shift your skin and eyes and such to something that can handle the friction," Hermione cautioned. "I imagine windburn at those speeds would be like being sandblasted."

"Ghostform," Elysia said. "That's my secret weapon for the Tournament. Anything like that comes up, and a quick _mamuzko forma_ and I'll just ghost right through it."

"I think I like the Amharic variation better," Hermione quipped. "It's got telekinesis built in. No having to split focus for another spell."

"Good point," Elysia acknowledged. "But anyway. The Firebolt has a windscreen charm out to a couple of feet. Anything much smaller than a snitch gets shunted around. If I stretch it out to wrap completely, that should take care of both windburn and drafting problems. And if I can work in a silencer somehow, that should help mitigate the sonic boom. Leave the eardrum-shattering to Lemmy."

Sirius cackled. "Let me guess, 'Ace of Spades?'"

"Damn right! Ooh, that reminds me, any of you lot want to watch the Weighing of the Wands highlight reel in the pensieve?"

### Hogwarts Grounds, Scotland	1994/11/05, 08:30	Bonfire Night

They _did_ manage to get back to Hogwarts and into bed before dawn, as it turned out. Granted, it was a near thing, but Elysia still managed most of a full night's sleep. After the late night, she felt justified in skipping most of her training for the day, but she still met Hermione and Luna (and now Ginny and Nell) for a quick run before breakfast and some calisthenics on the grounds right after.

As it was later than they were usually out, other students were around enjoying the comparatively warm (though cloudy) weather. They saw Millie, Lisa, and Megan having a picnic by the lake, and Izzy doing pull-ups on a convenient tree. 

("Merlin and Morgana, that girl's buff!" Nell commented as they drew close enough to see her muscles straining her workout gear.) 

Cormac McLaggen, a Gryffindor 5th-year, was flying around on his broom and leered at them until all five of them hit him with a targeted "you're a bug and I'm going to splat you" aura, at which point he paled and flew off, nearly crashing several times.

"You lot are scary sometimes," Izzy commented.

"Oh, hey Izzy," Elysia said, making introductions.

Izzy dropped down from the tree she'd still been hanging from. "So what brings you all out here on such a cold, grey day?"

Hermione snorted. "Cold? Grey I'll grant you, but this is positively _balmy_ for Scotland in November. Why, it's practically summer still!"

"Plus, all the exercise warms you right up!" Luna added.

Just then, Anna walked by in track pants and a sports bra, her hair back in a tight pony-tail. "How can anyone stand this heat!" She complained in Russian. "These girls in _jackets,_ of all things. How do they not melt?"

("Oh, I am _way_ too gay for this," Izzy muttered, biting her lip.)

"It's hotter now that you're here," Elysia said in Russian, winking.

Anna blushed, eyes wide in surprise.

Hermione smacked her arm, laughing, and Luna giggled.

"What?" Elysia said in Basque, with an impish grin. "It's fun to fluster the stoic ones."

Izzy giggled. "No wonder they call you Heart-Breaker," she teased, switching back to English. "What exactly did you say, anyway?"

"She said," Anna said with an odd sort of tone to her voice, "that it's hotter now that I'm here."

Izzy whistled. "Smooth. Wish _I'd_ though of it." She winked at Anna. "True, too. I feel my temperature rising already."

Anna blushed deeper, biting her lip.

"Yeah, what the hell, Potter? You weren't this smooth last year," Ginny said.

"You weren't this smooth _last week,_" Nell added.

("Yes, she was," Luna said smugly.)

"It's like I told Hermione over the summer. It's easier when you're not that invested in it."

Anna cocked an eyebrow.

Elysia shrugged. "You're like three years older than me and I'm very much taken by these two," she responded, wrapping her arms around Luna and Hermione.

"It is easy to forget you are so young," Anna said. "You carry yourself well."

"My dad's probably spinning in his grave as I say this, but that's Professor Snape's fault," Elysia said. "He told me the other day to have a song playing in your head and pretend you're the rock star, and _own_ it. Seems to be working."

"Much like my own method, then," Anna said approvingly. "Shoulders back, stride evenly, and think, _murder._"

"Ooh, I _like_ you!" Ginny exclaimed with a grin.

"You are a bit young for me, I think," Anna said, deadpan.

Ginny blushed.

"How about me?" Izzy said, prowling closer.

"Hmph. We shall see," Anna said, her eyes sparkling mischievously.



+++++



After a late breakfast, wherein Rita Skeeter's article about the champions proved to be as fair as promised, Elysia went with Nell to speak with Professor McGonagall about switching dorms and about leaving the castle to get her a new, more appropriate, wardrobe. McGonagall offered to take her to get the basics, and anything more could be acquired at the next Hogsmeade weekend on the 19th.

"I'm surprised at you, Miss Longbottom," she admonished. "You're certainly not the first girl in your situation I've had in my care. Had you but told me, I would've helped you have the ritual performed through proper channels."

"I know," Nell said, hanging her head a bit. "But my gran would never listen. Sometimes it's easier to ask forgiveness than permission."

McGonagall sighed. "Augusta can be particularly stubborn at times, 'tis true. Well, you'll hear no more of it from me, unless you would like my assistance with your grandmother when the time comes."

Nell smiled. "I'd very much appreciate it."



+++++

### Room of Lost Things, Hogwarts	1994/11/05 13:45	Bonfire Night

After Professor McGonagall left with Nell, Elysia took the opportunity to retrieve the Diadem from the Room of Requirement. She met Robbie and her girlfriends outside the Room and they went over the plan, such as it was.

"So that's it?" Hermione said. "Just walk up and hit it with the horcrux-zapper? What about if it has _other_ curses?"

"It probably does," Elysia agreed. "But they'll be much easier to deal with in a proper workspace, which the Room of Lost Things most certainly _isn't._"

"And what about traps in the Room itself?"

"That's why I'm not going it alone. You and Luna are both much better at analysis than me, not to mention curse-breaking proper. And then there's Robbie. If the four of _us_ can't handle whatever's in there, I think even Dumbledore would have trouble."

"We've got this!" Luna exclaimed.

"Thank you for doing this with me, my loves," Elysia said, kissing them both. "And you too, bro," she added, hugging Robbie.

Hermione and Luna slipped their goggles into place, and Elysia flipped her glasses into Active mode. She paced back and forth three times, thinking "I need the place where everything is hidden."

The door appeared, and in they went.

"My goodness," Luna exclaimed. "There's _mountains_ of stuff in here!"

"It's worse than the Wardstone Chamber," Hermione agreed, sighing.

Elysia grinned. "_Monstrant viam!_"

The other two girls face-palmed. Robbie chuckled.

A glowing path drew itself out from Elysia's feet, and the four of them took off, flying high enough to avoid most of the piles of detritus.

"How does this place work, I wonder," Luna mused aloud as they flew. "The Room isn't static, so I'd imagine the usual sort of wards wouldn't stick."

"I don't know about the Room," Hermione said, "but I'd think that means most of the Diadem's defenses would be tied to it directly. Compulsions tied to trigger-fired curses, contact poisons, that sort of thing. Perhaps it's in a box, and _that's_ warded and trapped."

"Given that our boy Tomothy hid the thing here when he was supposedly interviewing for the DADA position," Elysia commented, "I don't think he had much time to set up defenses. My money's on him trapping the Diadem itself, no matter _how_ the Room works."

"Makes our job here simpler, at least," Robbie said, snickering at 'Tomothy'. "And there it is!"

In quite the anticlimax, the glowing path led straight to what, if they hadn't known better, looked like nothing so much as a piece of cheap costume jewelry, nestled among a pile of oddities -- a dusty old wig, a chipped bust, stained robes. Their goggles showed plenty of magic on the Diadem itself, but no ward-lines, or any other magic aside from the Room's ambient aura.

"Here's hoping the rest of it's this easy," Elysia said. "_Suntsitu arima lotua!_"

A bolt of magic, the color of which none of them could quite process, flew from her wand and struck the Diadem with the sound of a large bell tolling far away. A cloud of black smoke flowed from it, as if a candle had been snuffed, and a haunting scream could be heard, as if from an out-of-tune radio station, until it dissipated completely.

Hermione conjured a lead box, which Luna levitated the Diadem into. They could feel a compulsion to wear the Diadem as it drew near, but their occlumency held. Then the four of them flew back out to the hallway, where Elysia reset the Room to be a fully-equipped Enchanting workshop.

"_Tempus,_" Hermione muttered. _15:12._ "We've got just under three hours until dinner."

"That should be enough to at least get an idea of what we're dealing with," Luna said. "Though whatever it is, it's _mean._ The wrackspurts are _swarming_ around it."

She had placed the now-open box on a shielded work table (which looked quite a bit like a quarantine station in a biology lab) and was peering at the Diadem through an enchanted lens. The others joined her, and after much investigation, they realized just _how_ mean.

"I-is that a _soul virus!?_" Hermione gasped, a look of abject horror on her face.

"That's _abhorrent!_" Luna exclaimed, outraged.

"This might actually be worse than the horcruxes," Elysia said faintly, face pale.

Robbie shuddered with revulsion, and then asked the important question. "Can we salvage the Diadem, or do we give it a bath in basilisk venom and dry it off with fiendfyre?"

_Take off and nuke it from orbit,_ Janet said, with the feeling of ice-water trickling across Elysia's scalp. _Rowena left you the original recipe, so you can fry this one but good._

"Janet says I've got instructions on making a new Diadem," Elysia informed the others. "Let's wipe this abomination from the face of the planet."

### The Three Broomsticks, Hogsmeade, Scotland	1994/11/06 12:00

They spent the next morning in Elysium, preparing for the lunch interview with Rita Skeeter. By the time Elysia walked into the Three Broomsticks at noon, she felt pretty good about it all.

A man in business robes met her as she entered, introducing himself as Solicitor Marius Bulstrode.

"Ah, you must be Millie's father!" Elysia exclaimed, shaking his hand.

"Indeed," Solicitor Bulstrode agreed. "She speaks quite highly of you."

"It's mutual, I assure you."

They headed back to a private room, where Rita met them a few minutes later.

"Miss Potter!" She greeted, a predatory gleam in her eye.

"Rita!" Elysia said, radiating affability. "I thought I told you to call me Ellie. Drink?"

"Don't mind if I do," Rita said.

"Rita, this is Marius Bulstrode, of Eberhardt, Bulstrode, & Tonks. We have a proposition for you."

Rita raised one eyebrow, hastily swallowing her sip of firewhiskey. "Do tell."

"We're going to take down Albus Dumbledore."

Rita dropped her glass.



+++++



After Elysia gave Rita the broad-strokes story of how Albus Dumbledore had screwed her over, including the sealing of her parents' will, conversation turned to Sirius Black.

"You mean to tell me," Rita said, aghast, "that a Lord of a Most Ancient and Noble House was imprisoned for over a decade _without a trial?_"

"And Dumbledore was in on it," Elysia confirmed. "You see why I want to take him down. One single man shouldn't have that much power, or that much blind trust."

"But _why?_" Rita asked.

"Because someone faked a prophecy and in his desperation he took it to be about me. Well, me or one other, and he set up both sets of parents to see which. And he was -- and is -- arrogant enough to believe that only he is wise enough to be able to dictate my so-called destiny. Never mind that he's obsessed with sacrifice and redeeming the unrepentant at the cost of those who never fell in the first place. Just look at his policy on bullying."

Rita nodded faintly.

Solicitor Bulstrode spoke up. "We'd like you, Ms. Skeeter, to work with our firm in an investigative capacity to build our case. We have all the testimony we could ever wish from Miss Potter, but we need to gather corroborating evidence as well. In return, you get exclusive rights to all stories stemming from what is uncovered, contingent on approval on behalf of Miss Potter before publishing, of course."

"Of course," Skeeter murmured. She finished off her drink. "Well, this is quite a lot to process. But I think -- provisionally -- that I'm in. Where do we start?"

"Sirius' lack of a trial, I think," Elysia said. "There are public records there that not only prove the matter, but bring up openings to all the rest. And I'm pretty sure Gringotts can say conclusively whether or not Peter Pettigrew is still alive -- and time of death if he isn't -- if the Wizengamot formally requests the information."

"They can," Bulstrode confirmed.

"Well, then," Rita said. "Let's talk turkey."

The interview and contract negotiations took until nearly dinner time.

## Chapter 16: Don't Stop Me Now

The week leading up to the race, not to put too fine a point on it, flew by. The triad spent most of their spare time helping Elysia prepare. Between the three girls and Robbie, the modifications to Elysia's Firebolt only took a few hours, as it turned out, and so the rest of the time was spent practicing in the Room of Requirement, with Hermione and Luna (and frequently Nell, Ginny, and Ron) doing their best to throw Elysia off course -- or off her broom.

They quickly found that the most troublesome situations were when something interfered with Elysia's vision -- smoke, mirrors, and so forth. This led to a slew of adjustments to Elysia's glasses, from variable-frequency vision filters to a full ley line-based navigation suite built into the HUD (all of which were immediately copied to Luna and Hermione's goggles).

"What about echolocation?" Luna asked at one point.

"Not terribly helpful when you're flying faster than the echoes can bounce back," Hermione replied, "but it might come in handy for a different task."

"Can't hurt to add it now, anyway," Elysia said, suiting action to words.

Finally, the week was over, the preparations were done, and Elysia was as ready as she could be.

### Hex Games Stadium, Hogwarts Grounds, Scotland	1994/11/12, 10:30

"Welcome, one and all, to the first event in the newly-christened Hex Games!" Ludo Bagman's voice rang out. "Our six competitors are the best and brightest from the top three schools of magic in Europe, and they're raring to go on this beautiful November morning here at our host school, Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!"

The six champions were sequestered away in a tent just off the quidditch pitch, performing last-minute preparations under the watchful eye of Bartemius Crouch.

"Our event today is a five-lap, no-holds-barred broom race, on one of the most challenging courses ever devised! As the course is being assembled," Bagman continued, "allow me to direct your attention to the Judges' Booth, and the array of Projecting Pensieves just below it. Each of our champions will be given a special amulet with a monitoring charm, tying them to one of the pensieves. We'll be able to view all the action as if we were following just a broom-length or two behind! A seventh pensieve will give an overhead view of wherever the judges direct, so you won't miss a thing, folks!"

"That's your cue," Crouch announced flatly, handing out the amulets.

The crowd cheered as the air above the pensieves flickered to life.

"And there's the signal! Please welcome our champions!"

_Hit it, bro!_ Elysia sent.

As the six followed Crouch out to the starting line, they couldn't help but saunter to the beat of Judas Priest's _Living After Midnight._ Robbie faded the music out as they all took their places at the starting line. 

Elysia took the opportunity to transfigure her glasses into goggles, trimmed in gunmetal to match her Ironbelly jacket and boots. She'd popped out one day to pick up some leather trousers and gloves from a muggle motorcycle shop and charmed them to match, and now she zipped her jacket over a Motörhead tee and grinned up at the stands, where Luna and Hermione blew her kisses.

A black curtain hung before them, hiding the course for the moment. Elysia surreptitiously and wandlessly cast _phản xạ hoàn hảo,_ a Vietnamese spell for perfect reflexes. Her pupils dilated, her ears twitched, and a rush of static electricity swept across her skin.

"Champions, mount your brooms!" Bagman boomed. "Three, two, one, GO!"

The curtain fell. As Robbie took over the airwaves with Motörhead's _Ace of Spades,_ Elysia dropped a muttered (and unheard) "_kettenblitzschlag!_" behind her, triggered the modified windscreen bubble, and shot forward with an ear-splitting roar as the sound barrier shattered in her wake.

The spell she'd cast, an ancient German chain-lightning stunner, caught all five of the other champions. It didn't knock them unconscious, but it did lock their muscles for several crucial seconds -- plenty of time for Elysia to gain an early and dominating lead.

The curtain had hidden a tunnel of mirrors, twisting and looping all over Hogwarts' grounds, and Elysia's Perfect Reflexes spell was put to the test immediately. She tapped her goggles to adjust them to a spectrum the mirrors didn't reflect perfectly (a combination of radio and upper ultraviolet, which the goggles beamed out ahead of her into the dim tunnel of mirrors) and immediately had to veer left with a modified Split-S turn.

"Was that _lightning magic?_" An incredulous Bagman shouted over the music as the other champions began to shake off the stunner and get underway. "Yes indeed! Our youngest champion with an impossibly strong start, opening with the sort of magic long-thought only the stuff of legend, and following that up with the fastest start any of the judges have ever seen! I have with me Mikhail Engel, of Ellerby & Spudmore, makers of the Firebolt broom, who have graciously gifted several of our champions with Firebolts to help even the playing field. Mikhail, what _was_ that?"

"Well, Ludo," Engel said, a faint German accent tinting his words, "like most of the other champions, excepting Miss Delacour and her signature customized Volière Soleil, the young Miss Potter is definitely riding a Firebolt -- her own, first-run, serial number of 86 -- which should have a theoretical top speed of 250 miles per hour under ideal circumstances, such as a Suicide Dive. What we just witnessed was Potter breaking the sound barrier from a cold start, flying horizontally -- unless I miss my guess, going well over a thousand miler per hour!"

Bagman gaped like a fish as a collective gasp rose from the crowd. "But -- _how!?_"

Engel shrugged eloquently. "If I knew, we'd be selling it. At a guess, she stripped out the limiter spells, but without compensating for the resulting acceleration forces, she should have passed out almost immediately from blood-flow problems."

Just then, Elysia blew past them.

"And that's the first lap!" Bagman crowed. "Elysia Potter, with a time of just over 30 seconds! For reference, folks, this course was paced out with a Cleansweep 9 at 10 minutes per lap."

On the pensieves, the other champions were fighting a fierce neck-and-neck battle partway down the track until Elysia lapped them. The sonic boom knocked them about like toy boats in a bathtub when the dog jumps in, and the others found out the hard way that the mirrors had been charmed unbreakable -- and bouncy.

They'd barely gotten themselves sorted out and made it a scant few hundred meters down the track before she did it again.

"Right, that's it!" Cedric said. He waved his wand and conjured a net across the full span of the tunnel behind him.

They'd made it just far enough past that Cedric thought his net had actually worked, when Elysia blew past them yet again as if the net had never existed. Cedric chanced a look back -- his net was still intact!

As he watched, though, the net disintegrated into dust, wafting away on the breeze. He tore his gaze away just in time to avoid ramming headlong into the side of the tunnel.

And then she blew past him again, and all he could do was growl.

Back at the finish line, Elysia crossed for the fifth time, finishing her final lap with a Hammerhead Stall. She back-flipped off her broom at the apex, casting βροντή (_vrontí_), the Greek Thunder-Step charm, and free-fell into a Hero Landing with her broom swept back behind her like a sword as the ground cratered beneath her.

As she stood, the last strains of _Ace of Spades_ faded out to the absolutely deafening applause from the crowd.

"That might be the hottest thing I've ever seen," Luna gasped to Hermione, who agreed vehemently before dragging her down to meet their girlfriend on the sidelines with a crushing hug and many passionate kisses.

+++++



Madame Pomfrey insisted on giving Elysia a quick check-over, despite her complaints, but could find nothing wrong.

Elysia just shrugged, tapping her goggles with her wand to revert them to glasses.

Madame Pomfrey harrumphed and gave Elysia a mug of pickle juice. "Be sure to drink that all down, now, until it stops tasting good," she instructed. "All that wind in your face dries you out. You need to replenish your electrolytes."

"Cheers," Elysia said, toasting Madame Pomfrey and chugging the entire mug in one go, hands shaking as the adrenaline wore off.

They made it up to the stands while the rest of the champions were in the midst of their second lap. Robbie was there with a crate full of butterbeer and a tub of popcorn, accompanied by Sirius (in disguise, of course, with wavy brown hair to his shoulder blades, pulled back into a ponytail, and warm brown eyes that sparkled with laughter instead of his usual steel-grey), the Weasleys, and Nell. The three girls snuggled up together to watch the rest of the race.

"You're still on camera, Ellie," Hermione mentioned, grinning.

"Lucky them," Elysia smirked, planting another kiss on Hermione's lips.

"Ooh, nice Immelmann from Izzy!" Luna gushed.

For Izzy had narrowly dodged a hex from Krum as they rounded a vertical hairpin turn. Anna took the chance to pull ahead, neck and neck with Fleur. Cedric lagged behind a bit; it seemed that he'd yet to recover from his net gambit.

"Looks like quite the battle," Elysia said smugly. "Guess I got my wish after all."

"And what wish is that?" Luna asked, eyes twinkling.

"To watch the games from the stands, cuddled up with you two," Elysia replied, giving both girls a squeeze.



+++++



Finally, after another twenty minutes or so, Krum and Diggory crossed the finish line of their final lap, bringing the First Task to a close. Bagman gestured for Elysia to join the others for the final scoring.

Elysia kissed her girlfriends, grabbed her broom, and vaulted over the edge of the stands, hanging from her Firebolt by one hand as she drifted quickly down in a corona of illusory lightning, blowing kisses toward the stands the whole way. The crowd went wild.

"Sweet Circe," Izzy muttered. "Who even _is_ this girl?"

"Whoever entered her didn't know what zey were in for," Fleur agreed.

"And now, the times!" Bagman crowed. "In last place, with a time of 25:43, Viktor Krum!"

"It voss a lucky shot, Kozlov," Krum grumbled.

Anna sniffed disdainfully. "Luck had nothing to do with it."

"In fifth place," Bagman continued, "with a time of 25:42, Cedric Diggory!"

"That net cost you, huh?" Elysia said.

Cedric grinned sheepishly. "Didn't expect you to blow through it like it wasn't even there!"

"Disruptor. Remind me to show you later."

Cedric nodded as Bagman went on.

"In fourth, with a time of 24:16, Anna Kozlov!"

Krum shot her another glare. Elysia stifled a cackle.

"In third, with a time of 22:42, Izabella Maradona!"

Izzy bounced on her heels, waving at the crowd.

"In second, with a time of 21:12, Fleur "Flurry Rush" Delacour!"

Fleur waved as if she were in a pageant.

"'Flurry Rush'?" Elysia asked.

"I _do_ race professionally, you know," Fleur retorted.

"And today's winner, with a frankly unbelievable time of 02:33, our youngest champion, the Green-Eyed Lightning, the Girl-Who-Lived herself, Elysia Potter!"

Elysia bowed with a flourish to thunderous applause.

"That concludes the First Task of the first-ever Hex Games! We'll see you right back here in two weeks for a spectacle of daring, nerve, and prowess like you've never seen before: the Second Task!"

As the professors began tearing down the course, Bagman called the champions up to the judges' booth for an informal Q&A with Rita Skeeter. The other judges had already left.

"We were going to do this in the Great Hall," he said, "but it's so nice out today!"

"It is, at that," Elysia agreed, settling back between Hermione & Luna and cracking open a butterbeer. Her broom disappeared back into her left-hand mage-space holster. "Cast away, Rita."

The others emulated Elysia, conjuring comfortable chairs and settling back with their own drinks.

"I think we all want to know, Ellie," Rita began. "_How?_"

Elysia grinned as Luna and Hermione giggled. "Ellerby & Spudmore make a good broom," she understated. "I just took the limiter off and took a few steps to mitigate the maneuvering stresses -- the muggles call those 'G-forces', G for gravitational. For instance," she misdirected, "trousers charmed to tighten during intense maneuvering to keep the blood in the brain instead of pooling in the legs. It's a muggle fighter pilot trick, actually."

"Muggles can fly that fast?" Rita asked incredulously.

"Faster," Elysia said. "Supersonic flight's been routine for them since the 1950s or so. They have an airplane they call the Blackbird, which can fly at over Mach 3 -- Mach being a measure of the speed of sound. So Mach 3 means three times the speed of sound. They landed people on the moon, too, back in 1969."

The wizard-raised among them gaped.

"In comparison," Elysia continued, "stripping the limiter lets the Firebolt top out at roughly Mach 1.8 -- 1,300 MPH or so. And it handles like a dream even at speed, by the way," she added, shooting a look at Engel. "I'd say it hits top speed in a straightaway at maybe 6 seconds? Figure out the G-force problem and nothing can touch it. Otherwise the rider's likely going to black out and crash almost immediately. It's like being kicked in the chest by a giant."

"Try being caught in your wake," Cedric grumbled. "And what did you do to my net, anyway?"

"Oh, that," Elysia said, waving her butterbeer dismissively. "_Stör störningar._ Got that from my mum's old school notes. It's a degenerate form of _Evanesco;_ same wand movement, too. Only works on conjurations, though, and it's not a clean Vanishing so much as it destabilizes the thaumic matrix. Usually it causes the target to blink in and out of phase for a bit before going up in smoke. Not terribly useful, but Mum thought it looked cool, so she kept a copy. Dunno why it's in Swedish, though."

"It makes the Arithmancy a bit easier," Luna chimed in. "The Latin would be much longer, too."

Elysia nodded gratefully. "Makes sense. Thanks, Luna-love."

"Speaking of spells," Izzy chimed in. "What did you hit us all with right at the start? It left me twitchy for like half a lap!"

"That's a bit of a long story, actually," Elysia said sheepishly.

"It must be," Fleur said. "Lightning magic is ze stuff of myth!"

Hermione snorted. "That's only because anti-lightning wards are overly broad, and nobody bothered to update them over the centuries."

Izzy stared. "Wait, _seriously?_ Those things are _everywhere!_ Why didn't they just use lightning rods?"

"That's what _I_ said!" Hermione agreed. "Anyway, we fixed it."

"_What._" Cedric said.

Luna giggled. "We fixed it! There's a lightning rod at Hogwarts now, and the wards are fixed."

"By 'we'," Anna asked, slowly, "you mean your professors, right?"

Elysia winked. "That'd be telling."

"That's a 'no' if I ever heard one," Izzy muttered.

"And anyway," Luna continued, "Professor Snape is ecstatic about it. He actually did a happy-dance when he found out."

"That might have been because muggle electronics work here now," Hermione said. 

"Is _that_ why he's been so much nicer this year?" Cedric asked.

"Nah, he only found out a week ago," Elysia said. "The lightning ward's been fixed all semester. We've been having movie nights and everything."

"Ohmygosh, have you seen _Jurassic Park_ yet?" Izzy gushed. "It just came out on tape last month!"

Hermione's eyes gleamed.

Elysia giggled. "Hey Robbie? Think you can snag a copy by tonight?"

"No problem!" Robbie said, snapping a jaunty salute.

"Awesome! Movie night in the Room tonight, then! You lot care to join us?" Elysia asked.

"Yeah!" Izzy bounced gleefully in her seat.

"Alright," Anna agreed.

"*Ahem,*" Rita interjected. "You were saying about the lightning spell?"

"Oh, right. The chain-lightning stunner." Elysia grinned a bit sheepishly. "Bit of a family secret, that, sorry. You can't expect me to give away _all_ of my tricks, after all."

"A girl can dream," Rita retorted.

"And maybe someday that dream will come true," Elysia agreed. "But not in the middle of the Games! There's still five more Tasks to go, y'know, and I _am_ still the youngest competitor. This lot would stomp me flat if I didn't have _something_ to even the playing field."

Cedric snorted.

"What?" Elysia gave him a look. "Why do you think I went for sheer speed? I didn't want to get caught in cursing range!"

"Why don't I believe you?" Fleur muttered.

"Because you've seen me furious?" Elysia retorted.

"That would do it," Hermione said.



+++++



They talked for a little while longer, covering the exploits of each of the champions in turn. Finally, the siren song of lunch proved too irresistible, and they adjourned to the Great Hall while Robbie popped away to acquire a copy of _Jurassic Park._

That night after dinner, Izzy, Anna, and Fleur all joined Elysia's usual Movie Night group. (Cedric begged off as he already had plans with Cho, and Krum had grumbled that he had no interest in such idle frivolities -- which got an eyeroll out of everyone who heard.) They all sat around chatting after the movie, and Hermione explained that, while muggles couldn't clone extinct animals _yet,_ it was probably only a matter of time.[^3] The wizard-raised among them were shocked that muggles had their own form of bio-alchemy, and even more shocked that it was so developed. 

Ron also wondered what a dino-steak would taste like, and Fred & George had disturbing grins for most of the night. Elysia resolved to be more wary than usual where they were concerned.



[^3]: [Dolly the Sheep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dolly_(sheep)) was cloned from mature cells in 1996, with the by-then-extinct Pyrenean ibex following in 2009. While this isn't _quite_ the same technique as used in _Jurassic Park,_ it's close enough to prove Hermione's point.



+++++



The next two weeks were surprisingly uneventful. The girls spent a portion of every morning training at the Kiln, and most mornings Sirius joined them. Sirius got Elysia to give Remus the Secret to the Kiln the following weekend, and she spent an enjoyable day catching up. Remus also performed the Unlimited Flight ritual, though because of his lycanthropy he couldn't become a shifter yet. He kept making _Airwolf_ jokes, though nobody else got them.

That Sunday, Elysia and company happened to be in the Three Broomsticks when Hagrid passed by and surreptitiously dropped a note on her lap, covering it with his usual exuberant greeting.

_Wow, that was downright cunning for Hagrid,_ Hermione sent. _What's it say?_

_He wants me to meet him just before midnight, with my invisibility cloak,_ Elysia replied.

_Think it's about the next Task?_ Luna asked.

_Probably,_ Elysia sent. _Bit concerning, considering._

The others sent agreement tinged with trepidation.



+++++



That night, Elysia shadow-walked to Hagrid's doorstep with her cloak on, knocking three quick knocks. The door opened swiftly. 

"That you, Ellie?" Hagrid said, stepping out. He wore a flower in his button-hole, and had broken teeth from some poor comb stuck in his hair (which Elysia surreptitiously Vanished for him).

"It's me," she said, flipping back the cloak's hood.

"Righ'," Hagrid said. "Stay quiet, stay hidden, and stay close. There's summat ye should see."

"Gotcha," she said, flipping the hood back into place and casting a few stealth charms.

Hagrid led her over to the Beauxbatons carriage, where Madame Maxime met him with a smile. She wrapped a shawl around her shoulders, and they set off for what seemed to be a romantic moonlit stroll in the Forbidden Forest. 

Elysia followed them to a secluded set of paddocks tucked away in the forest, where great gouts of flame lit the night amidst shouting. As they drew closer, she could make out -- 

_Dragons!?_

_What._ Luna sent.

_There's a bunch of dragons in the forest! Hang on, Charlie Weasley's here too. Apparently the next Task is to get something out of the dragon's nest. Thank Merlin, I was afraid I'd be expected to kill the poor thing!_

Luna's relief was palpable. _So what do you think? Fast, flashy, effective, pick two?_

Elysia sent a mental smirk. _Why choose? Time to show off another lightning spell._

Luna cackled.



+++++



The next week, quite a bit of time was spent in Elysium running scenarios and choreography. None of them knew for sure what the final layout of the Task would be, so Elysia ran timing drills with _tximista ibili,_ the Lightning Leap spell. She'd decided on entering to AC/DC's _Thunderstruck,_ and since she didn't expect this task to take very long at all, timed her leaps to the song.

Since she'd seen not only Madame Maxime with Hagrid, but also Karkaroff skulking around in the shadows, it was likely the other schools' champions already knew about the dragons. She'd thought about mentioning it to Cedric, but he was always with Cho, it seemed, in a world of their own, so she finally resorted to having Robbie leave a note on his pillow. And by then it was already Thursday.

She wasn't too worried. Both Sirius and Remus would be there, and Sirius at least could handle a dragon no problem, if any of the other champions ran into trouble. Not to mention Dumbledore, little though she trusted him.

By the time Saturday rolled around, Elysia felt like she could finish off the Second Task in her sleep.



+++++

### Hex Games Stadium, Hogwarts Grounds, Scotland	1994/11/26	10:00

"It's another fine day here at Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry!" Ludo Bagman's voice boomed out. "Welcome, one and all, to the Second Task of the Hex Games!"

Elysia and the other champions had been sequestered in a tent a short walk away from the arena, and had been made to draw a numbered, animated miniature of a dragon from a sack. Elysia had drawn a tiny Ukrainian Ironbelly with a number 3 around its neck. Fitting, she'd thought, considering her favorite outfit.

"Now then," Bagman had said once they'd all drawn. "Your objective is to retrieve the golden egg, which if you can solve it is a hint for the Fourth Task. This is a test of your nerve and ability to think on your feet, so you'll only be allowed to bring your wands in."

Elysia took off her glasses and pendant, calling Robbie to hold them for her during the Task. "Are sizing-charmed clothes okay?" She asked Bagman.

"Oh, sure," he'd said. "As long as you don't try to put them on the dragon!" They'd laughed, and he'd left to begin announcing the event.

("Oh good," Izzy said, trying to look innocent.)

She'd flopped down on her stomach on the tent's floor to play with the tiny Ironbelly, which was small enough to sit in her hand like a kitten. Izzy joined her with her own tiny dragon, a Norwegian Ridgeback, as Krum was called out to face the Welsh Green. Fleur and Anna were sitting like twin statues, tension only visible if you knew what to look for.

"How can you lot be so calm about this?" Cedric railed, pacing back and forth and running his hands through his hair.

"Well, it's a bit late to panic now, innit?" Elysia retorted, stroking the Ironbelly's snout.

"But it's a _dragon!_" Cedric exclaimed.

"And you without a will?" Elysia said. "You _do_ know people have died in past tournaments, right?"

"It just never hit me quite like this before," Cedric admitted.

"Better now than when you're staring down its jaws."

"Are you _trying_ to psych me out?" Cedric growled.

Elysia winked. "Is it working?"

"Yes!" He yelled.

Anna snorted. "Be glad you didn't get the Horntail."



+++++



"Next up, our youngest competitor, Elysia Potter!" Bagman announced.

Robby pressed Play and hit the boom-box with a _sonorous._ The opening strains of AC/DC's _Thunderstruck_ began to ring out across the stadium.

_Go time,_ Elysia thought, entering the arena in time with the beat as the first verse started. The muggle-raised attendees were on their feet, stamping and shouting along, to the bemusement of the others (not to mention the enormous dragon across the arena). She played her own variation of the classic drinking game, and every time the song said "thunder!" she'd cast 球電 (_kyuu-den,_ a Japanese ball-lightning spell). The orbs flared to the melody. The audience loved it, and the dragon was entranced, moving like a charmed cobra as its head followed the orbs around the arena.

She hopped up on a boulder for a better angle as the minute-fifty mark arrived. "You've been --" Brian Johnson's screech echoed across the stadium, and Elysia raised her wand, tapping her foot in time and muttering "_tximista ibili_" (which translated to "ride the lightning" in Basque, but she wasn't as much of a Metallica fan).

The drums hit, and with it an echoing double-boom of thunder as she leapt across the arena to the golden egg in a bolt of lightning, scooped it up, and then rode another bolt to the arena's exit. The remaining orbs of ball-lightning exploded in showers of sparks.

"Thunderstruck!" The crowd yelled.

Elysia raised the egg high above her head, then bowed with a flourish. The crowd roared, the music faded out, and she sauntered off to be swept into a bone-crushing double-hug from her girlfriends.

In the distance, she heard the dragon hiss, "what the _fuck_ was that!?"

"The Green-Eyed Lightning does it again!" Bagman shouted. "Our youngest champion is by far the fastest to retrieve her egg, in a stunning and flawless performance! Let's go to the judges!" He waved his wand, and a large, glowing '10' appeared. The others followed suit. Even Karkaroff couldn't find fault; he had a sour look on his face as he gave his score.

Elysia, Luna, and Hermione made their way into the stands to join Remus and Sirius (in disguise again). They looked quite cozy together, and when Elysia raised an eyebrow Remus blushed.

"Hey, who am I to judge?" She said, snuggling between Luna and Hermione. "Anyway, how's the competition so far?"

"Compared to you? Dismal," Sirius said. "Krum tried cursing his dragon in the eye. He made the shot, but she trampled half her eggs and clawed him pretty good before he made it out."

The girls all winced at that.

"Miss Delacour fared somewhat better," Remus picked up the thread. "She put her dragon to sleep somehow --"

 "-- And half the stands --" Sirius cut in.

 "-- But Chinese Fireballs apparently breathe flames when they snore, and her skirt caught fire before she made it out."

 "Who wears a skirt when facing a dragon?" Hermione scoffed. "Honestly!"

 "Hey, it was the most exciting part of the whole thing!" Ron protested, from the next row down. He was promptly smacked upside the head by Ginny, who then went back to cuddling with Nell on her other side.

"Anyway, they're both back in the healers' tent," Remus added.

("When did _that_ happen?" Elysia nudged Hermione, gesturing to Nell and Ginny.

"The night you went to see Hagrid," she answered. "Nell was in a bit of a panic at first and asked my advice."

"Good for them," Luna said, snuggling closer herself.)

"The handlers have switched dragons," Bagman boomed, "and now it's time for Durmstrang's second champion, Anna Kozlov!"

> To Do:

> - [x] Deal with the dragon in the Second Task



+++++



The last three champions put on a good show, Elysia had to give them that. Anna went for a sensory-overload approach, with lots of colored, scented smoke, sparks, loud noises, and a clever disillusionment charm which _almost_ got her through the ordeal unscathed. Unfortunately, Hungarian Horntails are aptly-named, and she was caught by a tail-horn as she made her escape. It went straight through her left arm and sent her flying halfway to the exit.

Elysia winced. She knew from experience that Anna was looking at a night on skele-grow at minimum for that, and resolved to drop in on her later to help break up the painful monotony of re-growing an arm.

Izzy, mad little ball of energy that she was, did something _nobody_ saw coming. She cast an engorgement charm on herself until she was as big as the dragon (a familiar-looking Norwegian Ridgeback), then went hand-to-claw with her: first punching her in the snout as the dragon reared back to breathe a gout of flame, then suplexing her and putting her in a dorsal body-lock with a choke-hold until the dragon passed out. Then she simply dispelled the _engorgio,_ picked up her egg, and swaggered out of the arena.

"Holy fuck," Elysia breathed.

"And _we're_ the scary ones?" Luna asked rhetorically.

("Norberta!" Hagrid wailed.

"Norberta!?" Hermione asked. "_Seriously?_")

"Did- did that just happen?" Bagman stammered.

Needless to say, Izzy also got a perfect score.

After that, Cedric really didn't stand much chance. He kept transfiguring boulders into livestock, attempting to draw the Hebridean Black away from her nest, but she was having none of it. Eventually, he switched tactics, transfiguring a bull which charged the dragon. Using that as a distraction, he skulked along the edge of the arena, then bolted for the nest. He'd just grabbed the golden egg and made a break for it when the dragon noticed him, sending a wash of flames over him. He stumbled out of the arena and was immediately whisked to the healers' tent.



+++++



With four of the six champions sequestered away in the hospital wing for the next few days, Rita Skeeter had to content herself with the two stars of the Second Task, Elysia and Izzy.

"So, Miss Maradona," Skeeter began. "Can you tell me _what in the name of Magic_ you were thinking?"

"Yeah, Izzy, you _suplexed a dragon._ Just. _Seriously?_" Elysia added.

"What, like you have a monopoly on arse-kicking?" Izzy retorted.

"That was one of the hottest things I've ever seen!" Elysia gushed, her girlfriends nodding emphatically alongside her.

Izzy blushed, but grinned. "Coming from Miss 'Hero Landing' that means a lot."

It was Elysia's turn to blush as her girlfriends giggled.

"You'll have to watch out for Charlie Weasley," Hermione said. "He's one of the dragon-handlers. Dunno if he'd want to kill you or kiss you for actually pulling off what you did."

"Either way, not gonna happen," Izzy said, laughing.

"So you've trained in muggle martial arts, Miss Maradona?" Rita asked.

"A few," Izzy replied. "Jiu-jitsu, mostly."

"I thought I recognized that hold!" Elysia said.

Izzy cocked an eyebrow. "You train too?"

Elysia nodded. "Yeah. Some jiu-jitsu, some soft-style kung fu, a few others."

"We should spar sometime!" Izzy gushed.

"Might could do," Elysia said. "Maybe we could make our wandless duel a _kumite_ match!"

Izzy held out her little finger. "I love it! Pinky pact!"

The two girls shook pinkies on it.

"I look forward to seeing that," Rita said.

"You need a nickname, Izzy" Luna suddenly said.

"Yeah!" Elysia agreed. "Hmm. What was that wand core of yours from again?"

"A matagot?" Izzy asked.

"That's it!" Hermione cried. "Izabella 'The Matagot' Maradona!"

"Perfect," Luna agreed sagely.

"Yeah, alright! It _does_ flow nicely," Izzy agreed.

"That settles it, then," Rita said.



## Chapter 17: Turn Me Loose

### Deputy Headmistress' Office, Hogwarts, Scotland	1994/11/27 19:15

As much of a whirlwind as November had been, December was a much-needed return to some semblance of normal, and gave Elysia the chance to catch her breath and take stock. The Hex Games, for all their flash and glamour, were a distraction from more important things, in the long term. Sirius was still a fugitive, Riddle still had horcruxes, and Dumbledore was still meddling. And beyond that, there were wrongs she could put to rights now, and just hadn't had a chance to yet: Remus' lycanthropy, for instance, and Nell's parents.

But on top of everything else, a new concern was dropped on her lap before December even arrived: the Yule Ball.

Unlike many of her classmates, her concern was not so much about asking the person (or _people,_ as the case may be) she liked. No, her problem was a bit trickier.

"What do you mean, 'only _one_ partner?" Elysia whined.

"I'm sorry, Miss Potter," Professor McGonagall said. She'd called Elysia into her office after dinner the Sunday after the Second Task. "It's in the tournament rules. The opening dance is a _paired_ waltz. The rest of the night you may do as you please, but not for this."

Elysia sighed, but then perked up as an idea came to her. "Well, then, milady McGonagall," she said, conjuring a bouquet[^4] of amethyst flower, butterfly orchis, _calla æthiopica,_ saffron crocus, reeds, and lyre-flower. "Mayhap you will grace my unworthy self with your illustrious company for the occasion, and we can show them how it's done." She presented the bouquet with a flourish, a wink, and a rakish, lop-sided grin.

Professor McGonagall laughed, blush staining her cheeks pink. "You charming rogue! Yes, alright, I'll open the Ball with you, you scoundrel." She conjured a vase for the flowers, placing the bouquet carefully within. "I'm sure Rolanda won't begrudge the one dance."

Elysia cocked an eyebrow. "You and Madame Hooch? That's perfect!"

McGonagall smiled warmly. "It is, rather," she agreed, a bit misty-eyed. "We've been friends forever -- were in Gryffindor together, in fact -- and when Elphinstone died, Rolanda and I, well..."

Elysia smiled. "I know what it's like to fall in love with your best friend. It's... special. And more than a little bit terrifying at times."

"Aye, that it is," McGonagall agreed with a wistful sigh. "And I'll let you in on a little secret: Rolanda is an animagus too. A great horned owl."

Elysia giggled. "_So_ perfect!"



[^4]: Using [this](https://files.magic-spells-and-potions.com/files/flower-language-dictionary.htm) flower-language dictionary, the bouquet means, in rough measure, admiration, flattery, and playfulness regarding the dance.



+++++



Rita's opening salvo appeared in the Sunday Prophet the week after the Second Task. It spilled the beans about there never being a trial for Sirius, and mentioned evidence that absolutely _had_ to have been suppressed, because otherwise there would have never been any doubt as to Sirius' innocence. The article ignited a wildfire of public outcry, that a Lord of a Most Ancient and Noble House could be so... _betrayed_ by the very system the Houses claimed as birthright. 

_Ironic,_ Elysia thought. _Still, it's nice to have the sheep stampeding against someone else for once._

A proper trial was scheduled for the end of the week. She and the others met every evening with Rita and Solicitor Bulstrode, who was representing Sirius, to prepare evidence and testimony. Elysia, Hermione, and Sirius had given memories, as well -- even Professor Snape had consented to provide his testimony and memories of the night Pettigrew had escaped last summer.

By some small miracle, they'd managed to keep the trial off of Dumbledore's radar. Solicitor Bulstrode said that because of evidence of Dumbledore's involvement in the whole sordid affair, he'd been able to convince Amelia Bones, the head of the Department of Magical Law Enforcement, to have Dumbledore recused from presiding over the trial due to conflict of interest. This meant that Augusta Longbottom, Nell's gran, would be presiding in his place.

"We'll have to cure your parents right quick then, Nell," Elysia said. "From what I've been told, it was Dumbledore who sold them out to the Death Eaters -- indirectly, of course, but there should be enough of a trail."

"Gran will be _furious_ when that comes out," Nell agreed. "Hell, _I'm_ furious."

"Me too," Elysia said. "Did you know that your mum is my godmother? If things had gone differently, we'd've grown up together, Nell."

"I've always wanted a little sister!" Nell smirked as Elysia put on an affronted face before giggling.



+++++



### Dai Llewellyn Ward, St. Mungo's Hospital for Magical Maladies, London, UK	1994/12/07	03:15

That night, Tuesday night -- Wednesday morning, really, well after Astronomy had ended -- Nell and Elysia shadow-walked into St. Mungo's under Elysia's invisibility cloak.

_You really think it'll be that simple?_ Nell sent hopefully.

_Conceptually, anyway,_ Elysia replied. _Obliviating that much psychological trauma after so long, though..._

_Yeah. Well, I suppose we'll find out in a bit, huh?_

_That we will. I'm glad Luna and 'Mione have such good control. Don't think I could do it myself._

They reached the end of the ward, where Frank and Alice Longbottom's private room was. Elysia flipped her glasses to active mode, seeing nothing of note, and they shadow-walked to the other side of the door.

_Monitoring charms on the beds,_ Elysia sent, _but nothing on them. You've got the spuds?_

_Here. I still think it's weird that they'll show as actual brains, even if they are comatose._

Elysia shrugged in response. _You and me both._

Nell pulled out a pair of potatoes and set them on the ground between the beds. Elysia gestured, transfiguring them into replicas of Nell's parents, then shifted one finger into a needle-like probe with a tiny eye, which she inserted into first one, then the other replica's ear. Using the probe, she carved runes of minor permanency into the ear canal behind the eardrum, where they would be almost impossible to notice unless one knew where to look. This way the transfigurations would hold until dispelled instead of fading over time.

_Merlin, that's unnerving,_ Nell shuddered.

_It's not any better on this end either,_ Elysia agreed.

They both cast wandless switching spells, trading the Longbottoms for their starchy doppelgangers. Some quick sleep and featherweight charms, and they each picked up a patient and shadow-walked to The Kiln.



+++++



Luna and Hermione were waiting for them when they arrived. They'd prepared the ritual room, and now they placed Nell's parents side by side in the center.

"Is everything ready?" Elysia asked. 

Hermione nodded. "Should be. I'll take Alice, and Luna will take Frank."

She lay down with her head towards the inside of the circle, on Alice's side. Luna copied her on Frank's side, and Nell lay down with her head towards her parents' heads. Elysia matched her at their feet. Sirius and Remus stood watch.

The four girls held hands and began chanting.

"_Animabus et mentibus intrare quod restituo. Et vectigal quidem damnis mederi vulneribus._"

As they chanted, a glow began to fill the circle. They closed their eyes, and when they opened them again, they found themselves in a white room with black curtains. On one wall, two doors stood closed. One was labeled 'Frank' and the other 'Alice'.

Elysia gestured, conjuring an orb of light. Two tendrils of magic sprang from it, one latching onto Hermione and the other Luna. A display flashed into place over the orb.

"Anchor and tethers are nominal," Elysia said, giving the screen a once-over.

Another set of tethers latched onto Elysia and Nell. "Power feed is green. Resonance feed is green. We are go." Luna and Hermione saluted, and stepped through their respective doors. "Good luck!"



+++++



Luna stepped into the heart of a maelstrom.



+++++



Hermione stepped into a dark, tangled forest, choked with poisonous-looking weeds.



+++++



"Contact. It's... going to take awhile."



+++++



After what seemed like days, with both Luna and Hermione drawing heavily on both Elysia and Nell, the maelstrom was quieted and the floodwaters retreated. The weeds were burned away and the forest bloomed with life.

Hermione and Luna returned through the doors, looking haggard.

"It's done," Hermione said.

Luna nodded, grabbing Hermione's hand like a lifeline.

"Damage report?" Elysia said, not without sympathy.

"Minimal," Luna replied.

"Ditto," Hermione agreed.

"Excellent," Elysia smiled tiredly. "Let's get out of here and get some rest."



+++++



### The Kiln, Red Wharf Bay, Wales, UK	1994/12/07	06:35

When the kids returned to school, Sirius and Remus awoke to stand watch over Frank and Alice.

"Just think, Moony, in a couple of days I'll be a free man! Legally!"

Remus snorted. "As if legalities mattered to you," he said fondly.

"Still, though!" Sirius said. He sighed, flopping on the sofa with his head in Remus' lap. "Merlin, what even is my life?"

"One hell of a ride," Remus said, running his fingers through Sirius' hair. "Can you imagine how Frank and Alice will feel when they wake up?"

"Thirteen years of hell? Yeah, I can," Sirius said, squeezing his eyes closed for a moment. "It's not going to feel real. It won't for awhile. Hell, it _still_ doesn't for me."

"Thirteen years of purgatory for me, but yeah. It's like a waking dream, being here with you, like this. Not to mention all the _other_ madness Elysia's brought with her this year. Seeing Lily and James again..."

"Yeah."

They sat quietly, enjoying the closeness and the quiet as the sun rose.



+++++



Alice woke first.

"Ow, my head... Neville!" She sat up quickly, flinging away an unfamiliar blanket. Looking frantically around, she noticed another bed across the small room, and a familiar head of hair upon the pillow. "Frank! Where's Neville?"

"Huh? Owwww..." he woke with a start, sitting up and cradling his head in his hands.

Sirius and Remus, alerted by monitoring charms, bustled in just then -- Sirius with a tea tray, Remus with several potion vials. They'd debated sending only a de-aged Sirius in first, to ease the transition, but in the end decided that would only confuse things.

"Good morning, sleepy-heads!" Sirius chirped. "Welcome back to the world of the living!"

"Sirius? Remus?" Alice stared. "Why do you look so... so _old?_"

Frank looked up at that. "Alice? Why do _you_ look so old?"

"Thirteen years in hell will do that," Sirius said. "Your kid's fine, by the way. Expect a visit after dinner this evening."

Alice wilted with relief.

"Wait, what do you mean _thirteen years!?_" Frank exclaimed.

"That's a long story that we've set aside the day to tell," Remus answered. "But first, we need to make sure you're up for it. Restoratives first, then we'll talk over tea."

He passed the potions out. Frank downed his immediately, smiling as the life returned to his atrophied body. "Come on, love, shake the dust off," he teased Alice.

She huffed, but assented and downed her own potions. "Oh wow, that's much better!" She exclaimed after polishing them off. "Merlin, how bad was it?"

"Pretty bad," Sirius answered. "I wasn't exaggerating when I called it hell. Best have some tea first." He poured a bracing cuppa for all four of them, setting the tray of nibbles to hover between the beds. Remus conjured chairs for himself and Sirius.

"Alright," Sirius started, once everyone was settled. "What's the last thing you remember?"

"I remember the wards fell, and those horrible Lestranges burst in -- and the Crouch boy! Barty Jr." Alice replied.

"I remember lots of _Cruciatus_ curses, but not the pain," Frank added.

"Looks like it worked, then," Remus said, shooting a look at Sirius.

"They're amazing, aren't they?" Sirius grinned. "You're next, you know."

Remus' eyes widened. "They can _do_ that?"

"Hey!" Alice cut in. "Can _someone_ explain just what is going on, already?"

Sirius and Remus shared a sheepish look. "Right, sorry," Remus said. "Long story short, 13 years and... a month ago, give or take -- the Lestranges and Barty, Jr. tortured you two into oblivion. You've been in the Dai Llewellyn ward at St. Mungo's ever since, until last night." He sighed. "And now the story gets... complicated."

Sirius patted him on the leg. "Now it gets _good,_ Moony."

"Well... that's debatable." Remus retorted. "Most of the '80s were pretty much purgatory for all of us."

"Point," Sirius acknowledged. "It was really only four years ago when things got... _complicated._" He waggled his eyebrows at Remus, who snorted and punched him lightly on the bicep.

"Neither of us were in the picture until last year, Padfoot."

"Yeah, yeah." Sirius rolled his eyes. "It all comes down to Ellie, though, doesn't it? And that's when it all started for her." He looked back to the Longbottoms. "First things first. Neville is Nell now, and Lily & James' kid Harry is Elysia. They're both in Gryffindor, and doing rather well for themselves in spite of everything."

Remus took up the thread. "They're also the ones who got you out of St. Mungo's. And along with Ellie's girlfriends, Hermione Granger and Luna Lovegood, healed you. That lot are a force to be reckoned with."

"Them and young Ginny Weasley," Sirius added. "Those girls are _scary_ sometimes. And we'd know; they've been training us. I think all of them can conjure the Singularity Shield now."

Frank and Alice looked at each other, then back to Sirius and Remus, eyes wide with shock.

Catching the Longbottoms up on the past 13 years took the rest of the day. They were still rather shaken by it all when the girls all piled out of what they'd assumed was a linen closet.
