# The List

## Summary

Harry is a trans girl, and ends up in the Afterlife (which looks suspiciously like The Good Place). The usual Reptilia28 challenge ensues, with a twist or two.

### Reptilia28 Challenge Details

> Harry is killed at 17 during the fight with Voldemort. He's sent to his Death's office (explained later) and finds out that this isn't the first time that this has happened.
>
> Harry's Death (who can have a human  name) is mad at his arrival. Apparently, people dying before their time is a black mark on the various Deaths' records, and Harry is getting  perilously close to getting this particular one fired.
>
> When Harry asks what was supposed to have happened, Death goes off on a rant saying how he was supposed to have killed Voldemort, found his soulmate ("Some Granger girl…") and lived to be a centennial age.  But since Harry keeps getting into life-threatening situations for one reason or another, he keeps dying before that happens. Harry is surprised about the soul mate part.
> Death gives Harry a paper to sign that allows him to retain his memories (the previous times, he wasn't given this option for some reason). Harry is deposited to a previous time of the writer's choosing.
> Eventually, Harry gets it right. He kills Voldemort, gets the girl, and lives to a ripe old age of whatever. And Death doesn't get fired.
>
> REQUIREMENTS:
> Harry must have died at least three times before this one. The memory keeping contract must  be included. Death must refer to Hermione as "some Granger girl" when Harry's soul mate turns up in his rant. Obviously, must at least be Harmony.
>
> OPTIONAL: Dumbledore's manipulations can be a factor in Harry's premature demises."

### Changes and Adjustments
> + Make A Wish: What if Harry really was just that good?
>+ Can't keep timeline memories, but can train up in the afterlife and keep that. 
>    + Training includes mind magics 
>+ Can make a plan with whichever advisors are desired. The plan lives in Harry's mindscape and can only be accessed during occlumentic meditation.
>+ Death (Eleanor?) grants a boon: limited precognition so Harry (almost) always sees a direct attack coming far enough in advance to counter it. This might just be on an instinctive level, or it might go so far as to be a full-blown vision, depending on the attack.
>+ No way is Eleanor getting fired, but she's a romantic at heart (and *really* wants to hook up with Destiny if she can help her latest pet project along).

## Chapter 1: Making Memories

### ?????	????/??/??	??:??

The first thing Harry saw was a white wall with green letters, which said, *Welcome! Everything is fine.*

*That's nice,* Harry thought. *I wonder where I am, though?* The room looked like a generic waiting room in a generic office, with a generic sofa facing the wall with its soothing message.

*For that matter,* Harry thought, *how did I get here? The last thing I remember was... Voldemort. And the Forbidden Forest, and a green light... He spouted some cliché monologue, too. What was it again? Oh, right. "Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived. Come to die."* Something about that line made Harry very uncomfortable, but she couldn't quite... wait a minute. *She!?*

"... Oh." Harry looked down at herself, and realized that for the first time she felt comfortable in her own skin.

Of course, the fact that she was wearing clothes that actually *fit* for once didn't hurt either.

A door opened off to the left, and a voice startled her out of her reverie.

"Ms. Potter? We're ready for you."



+++++



"Harry? Hi, I'm Eleanor," the blonde behind the desk said. "Have a seat and we'll get started."

Harry sat. The chair was surprisingly comfy.

Eleanor opened a folder on the desk, which Harry didn't think was there a second ago.

"So. First things first. You, Harry James Potter, are dead."

Harry sat up with a start. "Wait, what?"

Eleanor stared across the desk with an amused quirk of the eyebrow. "Again. You've died kind of a lot, huh? Not that it's really your fault. Your enemies cheat like my ex. This time they even got you to walk right into a Killing Curse, voluntarily. Not your best moment, though you *did* score major points for selflessness. Or, you would have, if it had made any difference at all. Sorry, kid, your heroic sacrifice was for nothin'."

Harry's jaw dropped. "You mean Voldemort *won!?*" She buried her face in her hands and growl-screamed into them.

"'Fraid so, kiddo. But don't worry! We got that horcrux out of you and you're in the Good Place now. Well, for the moment."

Harry looked up, hands still poised in case of further bouts of screaming. "For the moment? Wha-?"

Eleanor sighed, and slapped her hands on the desk. "Look, kid, I'm going to level with you. Most people, they kick the bucket, show up here or " -- she blew a raspberry and gave a thumbs-down -- "the Bad Place, work through a few Purgatory cycles, and move on. You're not most people. You got whammied by Destiny, so you get to go back and try again until you get whatever Destiny has in store for you out of the way." 

Harry put her face back in her hands and growl-screamed again.

Eleanor flipped through the folder. "Lessee here. Ooh, tough break, kid," she winced. "Destiny's kind of cruel sometimes. Don't tell her I said that, though; still trying to get her to hook up with me. She can *rock* that LBD, y'know what I'm sayin'?" She winked in exaggerated fashion.

Harry snorted into her hands and looked up with a surprised giggle.

"Anyway," Eleanor continued, "that Vole-dee-mort guy. Sounds like a rodent. Ya gotta *exterminate* him before you can get to the good stuff, which means *you* get to go back. Again. Geez, what is this, your twelfth time?"

Harry shrugged. "I don't remember."

"Oh, right, that whole wipe-your-memory-so-you-don't-break-spacetime thing." Eleanor groused. "Sorry about that. Not my call. I'm just filling in for Michael this go-round," she continued, *sotto voce.* "Poor guy gets a little stir-crazy every few Beremies."

Finally starting to relax, Harry settled back into her chair again. "So, um..." she started. "What's next? Actually, wait. First, why am I a girl? Or, why was I a guy? Or... whatever." She waved a hand vaguely. "Not that I'm complaining now, but what the *fork?*" Her eyes widened. "Fork? Why can't I say 'fork?'"

Eleanor grinned. "Yeah, that's from the first draft of the Good Place. We all thought it was funny, so it kind of just stuck around. And you've always been a girl, Harry. You just never got the chance to show it back on Earth. Blame Bumblesnore, or whatever his name is, for that. Devious little shirt was worse than that Vole guy, in some ways." She flipped through the folder again. "Wow, what a jerk! Talked you into eating that AK, left you to rot in Durzkaban, kept all *kinds* of secrets from you, potioned up you and your potential soul-mates to keep you apart -- especially that Granger girl." She looked up, eyes blazing. "Sean's going to have a *field day* with him."

"Hermione?" Harry blurted. "*She's* my soul-mate?"

"*Potential* soul-mate. You've run across a couple, looks like. It really just means that you're super-compatible and you *get* each other. Or *can,* eventually. Looks like that Lovegood girl's another one."

"*Luna!?*" Harry squeaked.

"Yup!" Eleanor chirped. "Ooh, and they're both potentials for each other, too. How's *that* for good luck?" She winked at Harry again, and waggled her eyebrows outrageously.

Harry blushed beet-red. "I... I... Um..."

"Woah, easy there, Beyoncé," Eleanor grinned.

Harry just looked confused.

"Beyoncé? Like, Destiny's Child? Because you're a Child of Destiny?"

Harry looked even more confused, somehow. Eleanor sighed. "Jeez, kid, get a radio."

Harry shook her head. Pulling herself together finally, she asked, "So, what, I need to go back, kill the Dark Plonker once and for all, get the girl -- girls? -- *be* a girl, and live to a ripe old age? How am I supposed to do that if I keep forgetting everything every time I go back?"

Eleanor thought for a minute, then grinned. "Janet!"



+++++



Janet, it turned out, was a hyper-evolved sentient interface to the sum total of all knowledge in the universe, and an absolute sweetheart too. Between the three of them, a plan was soon formed.

"Just sign here, here, and here," Janet said, handing Harry a contract. "This should keep the Judge happy. It says that, while you won't remember your last life, you can keep your training from here in the Good Place in your subconscious, and a plan of action in your occlumency mindscape. Basically, you'll get mind magic training first, and everything after that gets tucked away in the mindscape you'll build as part of that. You'll still have any instincts and muscle memory that result from any training you do here, and the actual knowledge will come to you if you focus on it. But you won't remember your time here, or anything like that. Just your training, and not as lived experience. It might feel weird at first when you go back."

Harry smiled nervously. "It's better than going back blind like before, I suppose."

"Right?" Eleanor said. "Well! That's settled. Let's get to it! Janet made a sweet little place for you to train, and... 'live,' I guess? I mean, you're dead, but..."

"The word you're looking for is 'reside,' Eleanor," Janet interjected with a smile.

"Thanks, babe," Eleanor said. "Anyway, she named it Elysium after some ancient Greek idea of a hero's afterlife. Seemed fitting."



+++++



"This. Is. Awesome!" Harry gushed, looking around her own personal Elysium. There was a cozy-looking cottage, some lightly-forested grounds at the edge of a crystal-clear lake, and a *quidditch pitch!* The lake had a small cabana on its beach, a fire pit next to some log benches, and a few large boulders perfect for sunning or diving. The grounds had a large grassy clearing, with a perfectly round border of white stone.

Janet had a smug smile, and Eleanor was grinning like a Cheshire cat. "Wait 'til you see the inside!"

They walked into the cottage and Harry *squealed.*

"Oh Merlin, it's *wonderful!*"

The door opened into a main room with a sunken den area, ringed with squashy sofas, facing a hearth with several hooks on swiveling arms mounted to one side. Through one doorway was a roomy, well-appointed kitchen with plenty of counter space, and through another was a huge, well-lit study, with shelves and shelves of books, big bay windows with reading nooks, a large desk, and several squashy armchairs. A door in the kitchen turned out to be a staircase down to a fully-appointed basement potions and enchanting workshop. Last there was a door across the den area which led to a large bedroom with a king-size four-poster, with French doors opening onto a deck facing the lake. Across from the French doors was a bathroom with a sunken jacuzzi tub. The whole place had a cozy, rustic aesthetic which Harry found thoroughly comforting.

"I should hope so," Janet said. "I got it from your past lives' daydreams about having a place of your own. With a few modifications for the training you'll be undertaking, of course."

"Oh, right. About that," Harry said. "What's the plan?"

Janet and Eleanor looked at each other and grinned.

"Montage?"

"Montage."



+++++



Time, such as it was in the Afterlife, passed in a blur. (And frequently with an '80s rock backing track, courtesy of Janet.)

It wasn't all training, either. Since it *was* the Afterlife, after all, Harry could meet with other dead people. She got to train with some of the greatest witches and wizards who ever lived, and several mundane masters as well. But she also got to spend time with her parents. 

James and Lily were both brilliant, though each had their specialties. And it turned out that both were brilliant flyers, both on a broom and without. One of the perks of being dead, apparently, was that gravity was more of a suggestion than an actual law. Not to mention animagus training; while neither James nor Lily had flight-capable forms, Harry was a peregrine falcon. Because of course she was. Lily named the form Nemesis, after the Greek goddess of retribution.

And speaking of shape-shifting, Harry was also a latent metamorphmagus. The overnight hair-growth incident after a bad haircut during Harry's childhood had been an unmistakable sign, if only anyone had known to look. Oh, she wasn't nearly as innately talented at it as, say, Tonks, but the possibility was there, and so she was trained in that too. This, coupled with her animagus training, of course led to some interesting possibilities which were thoroughly explored.

She trained in mental magic, myriad styles of martial arts and dueling, melee weapons, archery, firearms, spell-crafting, wandless magic, wards, enchanting, engineering, math, science, logic, rhetoric, deportment, politics, history, and many *many* other subjects. Her tutors crammed her brain full of every last bit of knowledge, skill, and instinct they thought could possibly be beneficial. If she hadn't already been dead, she felt, it might've killed her all over again.

Eventually, after a time impossible to quantify by mortal standards, she was ready.



## Chapter 2: Keep In Mind

### #4 Privet Drive, Surrey	1994/06/26	04:30

Harry woke with a start. 

Fading moonlight streamed through the window, making the sleeping Hedwig's feathers glow softly. 

Checking the time on the battered old alarm clock Dudley had thrown against the wall one morning because he hadn't wanted to get up for school, Harry saw that it was still a couple of hours before sunrise. Hogwarts had let out only yesterday, and normally he slept like the dead that first night back.

Wait, *'he?'* Why did that feel so much more uncomfortable than usual?

A sudden headache stabbed his brain all over, and he fell back to the mattress with a groan.

"Hi, I'm Janet!"

"Aagh!" Harry yelped, jolting upright. She looked around in a confused panic. *Wait, 'she?'*

She found herself sprawled on an almost unnaturally green lawn, with a rustic-looking cottage to one side and a lake-side cabana to the other. Standing over her was a pretty brunette with a clipboard.

Harry scrambled to her feet as the brunette -- Janet, presumably -- continued speaking. "Welcome to your mindscape, your own personal Elysium!"

"We -- we're in my mind?" Harry asked.

"Yup!" Janet chirped. "And I'm a personification of your subconscious. Walk with me, Harry." She started towards the cottage. "Long story short, you died. Again. We decided to give you an edge on your next life through, and all this" -- she waved vaguely around at the cottage they'd just entered -- "is part of that." She sat primly on one of the squashy sofas near the hearth and patted the seat next to her.

Harry sat. "So... why am I a girl here?"

"We're in *your* head, Harry. You tell me," Janet answered.

"... Oh. Huh. That explains a lot, I guess. So I'm dead?"

"No, not anymore, Harry," Janet replied. "You got sent back to get it right this time. You can't remember the past lives, though, because it would destroy the space-time continuum, so we sort of *cheated.* A little bit."

Harry raised an eyebrow.

"It's all here," Janet continued. "You left yourself a to-do list and some pointers. Most of the training-specific stuff is tucked away in your subconscious, tied to specific triggers; we didn't want to overwhelm you. But there are a couple of things you need to know up front."

"Like that I'm a girl?" Harry asked.

"No, that one was going to bubble up around this time in your life regardless. Puberty, don'tcha know. So we tied this first mindscape entrance to that realization as a trigger, since thanks to your between-lives training you can do something about it now."

"Really?" Harry said. A cold prickling sensation washed over her scalp. "Wait, don't tell me. I'm a shape-shifter, right?"

Janet stood with a smile. "Pretty much! Come on, it's time to show you the study."

They went down the hallway to a huge room filled with books, expansive bay windows with cozy-looking reading nooks, a substantial desk, and a floor safe tucked away in a corner. A black leather binder with a lock was sitting on the desk. Janet gestured to it. "Here's the list! It's full of useful foreknowledge, but you'll only be able to read the parts you can act on or already know about at any given time. Too much future knowledge cam mess you up. Your last self said it wouldn't do to have you too far out of sync with your peers, after all; you're too isolated as it is."

Harry nodded and opened the binder.

> #### To Do

> - Take the Knight Bus to Gringotts ASAP and get a full accounting
> - Establish a training regimen (see Appendix A)

"The primers contain the sum total of knowledge and training from your past life on that subject," Janet said. "You and your advisors decided the first order of business was a degree of independence, so everything on this first list is to make you more capable of fending for yourself without setting off the Trace or relying on the adults in your life who have proven less than helpful."

"Dobby, huh?" Harry said. "Why didn't I think of that?"

"You did," Janet smirked. "Anyway, as the personification of your subconscious, I can dig up anything in your mind you ask me to, unless there's a god reason not to. If that's the case, I'll tell you so."

"Thanks, Janet," Harry smiled.

Janet waved a hand, and a pile of books appeared next to one of the reading nooks. Harry spent the next little while flipping through them, realizing that far more knowledge was pouring into her mind than was written on the page. By the time she was finished with the first book, she understood why.

> To Do
>
> - ~~Find and read the primer on Mind Magic~~

"Bloody hell!" Harry exclaimed. "What a rush!"

"Wait 'til you read the next set,'" Janet grinned.

Harry dove right in, with a fervor that would have put Hermione Granger to shame.

"Woah," Harry said when she finally came up for air. "I know kung fu."

Janet placed a steadying hand on Harry's shoulder. "Now, remember, you don't have the physical or magical development yet to take full advantage of all you've just learned. Go slowly at first."

Harry nodded, with a huge grin on her face. "That's what the training regimen is for, yeah?"

Janet nodded. "You'll want to take care of the Gringotts business first, so you and Dobby can get any equipment you'll need."

"Gotcha."

Harry dove back in.

> To Do
>
> - ~~Find and read the primers on Goblins, House Elves, Public Speaking, Negotiation, and Finance~~

"The sun's coming up, Harry," Janet said as Harry finished the last of the books. 

"What? I've been here for hours!" Harry exclaimed. "Wait, I remember now. Time's different in a mind-scape, isn't it?"

"It is," Janet confirmed. "But that's all the books on that first list, so I'd say we timed things out rather well, wouldn't you?"

"You -- I -- we *timed* this? Merlin!"

"He helped."

"I.... sort of remember that?" Harry said hesitantly. "Like a dream, almost."

"You weren't allowed to keep most of your memories of the afterlife," Janet said. "Some of them, yes, such as that needed to effectively use your training, and a few of the people you trained with. Merlin, Morgana, Bruce Lee, the Founders... you'll remember bits and pieces, especially if it becomes relevant, but the only clear memories you were allowed to keep were of your parents."

"My... my parents?" Harry stammered.

"Go look in the bedroom," Janet replied with a soft smile.



+++++



The bedroom, it turned out, was empty. The deck beyond the French doors, however, was not.

"Mum? Dad?" Harry choked out, rushing to the deck.

James and Lily Potter turned and engulfed their child in a crushing hug.

Eventually, Harry pulled herself together. "You... aren't really here, are you? You're just personifications of my afterlife memories of you?"

"Pretty much," James shrugged. But there're a lot of those. Enough for us to *effectively* be here for you in Elysium, your mindscape, even if the real us can't be. Those versions of us are watching over you, though. You can be sure of that."

"We're so proud of you, honey!" Lily cried, squeezing Harry again. Harry squeezed back.

A trickle of memories crawled over Harry's scalp, helping to temper her emotions at seeing her parents again. *For the first time in this lifetime,* her memories whispered, *but not the last. They're right here!* She squeezed them one last time. "I guess it's time to get things moving," she said.

Her parents nodded, her dad with a devilish grin and her mom with a decidedly Slytherin smirk. "They won't know what hit them, Nemesis," she said.

James patted her on the back. "Go get 'em, kiddo!'"



## Chapter 3: Ellie and Robbie

Opening her eyes with a start, Harry looked down at herself. She was in boy-mode again; as uncomfortable as it was, she knew she would have to stay boy-shaped for awhile. All the more reason to get some independence, she supposed.

She went through her morning routine, including the silent treatment at breakfast with the Dursleys, then dug out her Gringotts key and money pouch and headed to the park down Wisteria Walk. Tucking herself away among a cluster of bushes, she called out softly, "Dobby!"

With a quiet *pop,* Dobby the House-Elf appeared. "Great Harry Potter Sir is calling for Dobby!" He gushed, bowing so low that his long, floppy ears brushed the ground.

"Dobby," Harry said, "How would you like to be my elf?"

Dobby nodded frantically, so overcome he could only squeak.

"Dobby, I claim you as my elf," Harry said, remembering the formal oath from her earlier reading. "My magic to your magic, my strength to your strength, my knowledge to your knowledge, my secrets to your secrets. Henceforth, you shall be known as a Potter elf. And as a part of my family," Harry added, though this wasn't in the formal oath. "So mote it be!"

A soft glow surrounded the two for a moment, and as it faded Dobby leapt to embrace Harry.

"*Family* to the Great Harry Potter! And so much *knowledge!* Dobby is... *overwhelmed!*"

Harry hugged back and smiled. "Me too, Dobby. We're going to really shake things up together, you and I."

"Great Harry Potter Miss has plans?"

Harry thought for a second. "First, Dobby, nobody else knows I'm a girl yet, and I want to keep it that way for now. Just call me Harry. We *are* family now, after all."

Dobby nodded, tears in his eyes and a smile on his face.

"Second," Harry continued, "I know that your speech patterns are because of your time with the Malfoys, but you're part of the Potter family now. You're not a servant, not a lesser being. You are Dobby Potter, and as such you're expected to stand tall and speak with confidence."

"I understand, Harry," Dobby said.

"I'm still working on that myself," Harry mused with a smile. "We can help each other out on that, yeah?"

"Okay," Dobby agreed.

"Thanks, Dobby. Now, I've got some plans for today. I want to end the day with more independence than I started it with, and the next step is to see what resources we have. So we're off to Gringotts," Harry said. "What do you think is the best way to do this? The Knight Bus, maybe?"

"Dobby can -- err, *I* can bring you straight to Gringotts, Harry. We elves has -- *have* our own kind of magic. Like apparition, only not, you see."

"That sounds good," Harry replied. "Shall we?" 

Dobby wrapped Harry in a hug, and they were off to Diagon Alley.

> To Do
>
> - ~~Bind Dobby as your house elf~~

+++++

They reappeared with a *pop* in a cordoned-off section of the Gringotts lobby, and Dobby immediately dragged Harry over to one of the lines. "So the next person doesn't be landing on you," he said. After a short wait, they got to a teller, who glared down at them from the abnormally high counter.

"Yes?" The goblin asked, in a rather put-out voice.

"May blood and gold flow at your feet. I'd like a full accounting of my holdings, please," Harry said.

"Key?" The goblin said shortly.

Harry handed over the key. The goblin took it and did something behind the counter, then handed it back. "Lockjaw will take you to an account manager. Lockjaw!"

Another goblin, Lockjaw presumably, led them through an opulent door into a maze of opulent hallways. Eventually, they came to another opulent door, which Lockjaw led them through before ducking back out.

Another goblin, built like a knarled old oak tree with a bushy white beard, was seated behind a desk, with a gas-lamp and several ledgers on it. He gestured to the chairs in front of the desk and introduced himself. "I am Claymore, the account manager for the Potter estate. I wasn't expecting you for a few more years, Mr. Potter."

Harry inwardly cringed at being addressed as 'Mr.' but shrugged it off. *Not yet,* she told herself. "Harry is fine, Claymore," she told the goblin. "May this meeting bring profits to our clans and ruin to our enemies." So saying, she had a seat in one chair and gestured for Dobby to take the other. "This is Dobby, my friend and advisor."

"Well met, Harry, Dobby. What brings you to Gringotts today?"

"I recently came to the conclusion that I have been far too reactive in my life thus far, and have decided to do something about it. The first step, then, is to take stock. So my first order of business is a full accounting of my available assets. Depending on the results, we'll go from there."

Claymore nodded and, after digging around in a desk drawer for a moment, produced a small, ornate stiletto dagger; a roll of parchment; a small screw-top inkwell; and a red quill. "Well then, Harry, what say we start with a lineage trace?" He screwed the inkwell onto the dagger's hilt and gestured for the back of Harry's hand. After passing the blade through the gas-lamp's flame several times, he gently slid the point into a vein. The stiletto blade, it turned out, was hollow, and Harry's blood began to fill the inkwell. 

Once it filled, Harry shifted the wound closed. Claymore blinked at this, but said nothing. Unscrewing the inkwell once more, he made some gestures with the dagger over the quill, dipped it into the inkwell full of Harry's blood, and set it on the now-unrolled parchment.

It began to draw quite rapidly, and after a few minutes, Harry could see a family tree. When it finished, Claymore waved the dagger over the inkwell and quill and the blood vanished. He placed everything but the parchment back in the drawer and gestured Harry closer.

"Well now, let's see... Hmm. No real surprises here... Oh! Seems you're in the line of succession for the House of Black. Well, no bearing on anything for today. One moment, I'll have a clerk bring the most recent statements."

Claymore knocked on a bronze pipe which was sticking out of the wall, then yelled something into it in Gobbledegook. Thanks to the Primer on Goblins Harry had read in Elysium that morning, she found that she understood most of it. It seemed that Lockjaw was Claymore's apprentice, and had been sent to Records for the requested statements. *Huh,* she thought to herself. *Hadn't realized I'd picked up Gobbledegook. Wonder what else I don't know that I know?*

Lockjaw entered the room a few minutes later, handed over a folder, and left again.

The rest of the folder was fine-print regarding the farm and business, but what caught Harry's attention (aside from the sheer amount) was that note about personal effects. *Perhaps something of my parents'?* Catching Claymore's attention, she asked, "Claymore, a couple of things have caught my attention. First, the portkey to the property at Red Wharf. Am I able to request use of that now, or do I need to wait until I come of age?"

"Well, I don't suppose there's any harm in you going to look at the place," he replied, "but ownership doesn't transfer to you until you come of age. Still, might be a good idea to be able to plan for it."

"Thank you, Claymore. I'd like to schedule that for tomorrow, then. And second," she continued, "do I have access to the storage vault yet, or only the trust vault? I'd like to examine the personal effects."

"You are indeed able to access that vault. I gather you'd like to do so today?"

"Once we're finished here, please. One last thing - I note that there is a significant amount of liquid assets in the main vault which are not being put to work. Is there anything we can do about that right now?"

"Very astute for one so young," Claymore nodded in approval. "Unfortunately, as far as the law is concerned, investment counts as withdrawal, so until you reach your majority neither you nor your guardians can do anything with it. Pity. That was mostly old Fleamont's proceeds from selling off his potions company when he retired. James, your father, never had a chance to do anything with it either. That money's been sitting idle for close to 30 years by now."

"How about the trust vault? What can you do with, say, 25,000 galleons? Something with aggressive earning potential, I'd hope. At, oh, 40% commission? That should leave enough interest income for discretionary spending, too."

"Now you're speaking my language, lad!" Claymore laughed. "Any particulars, or shall I use my best judgement?"

"I think we understand each other, Claymore. You'd know better than I what opportunities there are at present."

"I can think of a few, lad," Claymore said. "Magical only, or muggle as well?"

"Either or both, I should think," Harry said. "Which reminds me, I'll need to withdraw from my trust vault, and change a fair bit to pounds, at some point today."

"Aye, we'll get Lockjaw to take care of you, lad. Anything else?"

"No sir. Thank you for all your help today. May your enemies cower before you and your coffers never empty."

"Same to you, lad, same to you. Lockjaw!"



+++++



Lockjaw took Harry and Dobby much further down on the minecart than she'd been before. By the time they stopped, she could see the end of the tracks in the distance.

"Vault fifteen, Potter Storage Vault," Lockjaw announced. He hopped out of the cart, Harry and Dobby following, and stroked one long finger down the door. The door opened with a puff of green smoke, and the two entered. Lockjaw stayed at the entrance, unfolding a comfortable chair from seemingly nowhere and relaxing into it.

The vault looked like the back room of an antique shop. Furniture was stacked in one corner, bookshelves filled with books in another. Racks of portraits were next to a stack of trunks and several cabinets and credenzas. Rugs and tapestries lay rolled in piles along one wall. Each item had a small parchment tag attached. Next to the door was a roll of parchment with a list of tag designators matched to descriptions of the tagged items.

Dobby snagged the list and the two went over it for a bit, deciding what to focus on. While the folder Claymore had given them listed *what* was in the vault, there was so much that actually finding anything in particular took some doing.

The first thing Harry examined were the trunks. Most of them were the standard Hogwarts 'Firstie' trunk, but there were a few with substantial enhancements. A couple were even listed as "residential" trunks, which, when Harry opened them, turned out to contain an entire house's-worth of rooms inside. 

"Dobby, come look at this and tell me what you think," Harry called. She'd found that one of the residential trunks was made of *lignum vitae* of all things, which, according to the primer on Enchanting she'd devoured this morning, meant it could handle a much larger amount of magic without overloading. It also seemed to have a rather sizable runestone locus, though she couldn't find the stone that should have been inside. With no runestones, the interior of the trunk defaulted to a 10ft^3^ room, containing only the locus pedestal and the ladder out.

"D'you think," she continued, "that a trunk like this could handle a dueling chamber without burning out?"

Dobby squinted at it, then climbed down to examine the locus pedestal more closely. Climbing back out, he nodded. "A smallish one. Enough for three, maybe four people casting at once. More would be too much for the thaumic bleed-off rate."

"And maybe a smallish apartment, and a workshop, along with?"

"Oh, easily, Harry! Capacity is not a problem with this trunk."

Harry nodded. "I guess we're taking it with us today, then! We'll have to pick up a new control stone before we leave the Alley. Now, what about some of this furniture?"

In the end, they'd managed to find enough furniture to outfit a small two-bedroom apartment, journals from both James and Lily, several volumes of Potter Family grimoires, some House Potter elf uniforms (one of which Dobby promptly exchanged for his current garb) and several articles of clothing that looked to be close enough in size for Harry to shift herself into a perfect fit without it being obvious. The dragon-hide boots and matching jacket (Ukrainian Ironbelly) were a particularly nice find, and even had resizing charms worked into them. Harry decided to change out of Dudley's cast-offs before they continued their errands, and ducked into the trunk.

She emerged wearing close-fitting jeans, a black v-neck t-shirt, and the Ironbelly boots and jacket. She'd also shifted her hair into a rakish mop, making the usual messy bird's nest look intentional. In all, she felt comfortably androgynous. It wasn't quite as feminine as she'd've liked, but she felt far better than before.

"What do you think, Dobby?" She asked, spinning around.

"Very nice!" Dobby exclaimed.

*Now what was next on the list?* She thought. Dropping into Elysium for a second, she recalled the list in the binder. There was something new on the list, though upon reflection she'd already known about it.

> To Do
>
> - ~~Take the Knight Bus to Gringotts ASAP and get a full accounting~~
> - Outfit the trunk as a proper living and training space (inc. foodstuffs and utensils)
>
> - Establish a training regimen (see Appendix A)

The trunk had a few convenience enchantments which were standard for most high-end magical luggage. Self-shrinking, featherlight, and so forth. As such, once they'd gathered everything they wanted to bring from the vault during this trip, Harry shrank the trunk and slipped it into a pocket.

"Thank you for indulging us, Lockjaw," Harry said as they exited the vault.

They proceeded to Harry's trust vault, where Harry gathered a stack of 1,000 galleons with Dobby's help. Once back at the main floor, they bade Lockjaw farewell and stood in line to change half of the galleons to pound notes.

Back in Diagon Alley proper, it was time to find a replacement runestone. Harry and Dobby wandered down the main thoroughfare of Diagon Alley, chattering to each other about the shops they passed. In a luggage shop, Harry bought them both charmed bookbags which had an Undetectable Extension charm on them, as well as featherlight and durability charms. The proprietor also directed them to a shop up the Alley past Gringotts, where Harry picked up a variety of blank runestones and a high-end rune-carving kit. Stopping in at an apothecary, Harry purchased a stock of medical potions, expecting to need them after the intense training she was planning. She also picked up a stock of nutrient potions to help make up for her years of malnutrition.

Finally, finished with the magical shopping, they decided to head into the Muggle world. Stepping out of the Leaky Cauldron, but still within the pub's wards, Harry shifted into proper girl-form, with longer auburn hair. She looked around for Dobby, and found instead a boy who could've been her twin brother. He had hair the same auburn as hers, though cut in a shorter, more boyish style. He was even wearing a similar outfit.

"Wha- Dobby? Is that you?" Harry yelped.

"We're in the muggle world now," Dobby replied. "House-elves mustn't be seen by muggles. I borrowed your shifting magic through the house-elf bond. Does Dobby -- er, *do I* look OK?"

"You look *brilliant,* Dobby! You could be my brother, like that! Well, we *are* family now," Harry answered. "Although, 'Dobby' is kind of an odd name for a muggle. Maybe I should call you something else? How do you feel about 'Robbie?'"

"Could... could you call me that anyway?" Robbie asked. "I'm a proud Potter elf now, and I need a name to fit."

"Robbie it is, then!" Harry said. "Hmm. I suppose I can't really answer to 'Harry' like this, either. Can't wait to be rid of that name for good, but for now..." She sighed, leaning against the wall of the pub. "Wish there was some clue from Elysium."

"Elysiu- your mindscape?" Robbie asked.

"Yeah, there's all kinds of ideas kicking around in there," she replied absently. "Wait, that's it! 'Elysia!' Robbie, you're a genius!" She spun him around in a hug. "Just call me 'Ellie' for short!"

And so Ellie and Robbie set off down Charing Cross Road.


## Chapter 4

After a quick stop for lunch, the two wandered the shops for the rest of the afternoon. Elysia managed to find a full set of free-weights and some gym mats, as well as both a heavy bag and a speed-bag. Gloves were a non-issue as she could simply shift them into place as needed.

They also found more clothes. Both Elysia and Robbie were reveling in the ability to wear what they wanted to for once. Robbie, in particular, had a *penchánt* for socks with loud patterns, while Elysia enjoyed more form-fitting apparel after being saddled with horribly-oversized cast-offs all her life.

Lastly, they picked up kitchenware and several appliances, bedding, curtains, and the rest of the little things that make a house feel more like a home. And after a final stop at a grocer to stock their larders, Robbie popped them both back to Elysia's room #4 Privet Drive.

Robby, having returned to his natural elf form, began moving the perishable goods into some of the stasis cupboards they'd found in the vault. Meanwhile, Elysia dug out one of the new runestones and the carving kit, and sat down at the dilapidated old desk under the window to start laying out the new configuration for the trunk.

It was late into the night before she was finished. Hedwig had returned from hunting all day and was snoozing, head tucked under one wing, on the perch near the window, before Elysia sat back and called Robbie over.

"What do you think, are we ready to pop this in?" She asked, gesturing to the runestone.

He leaned over it, muttering quietly under his breath, and then nodded. "I don't see any problems. I've gone over the trunk, and it's charged and ready."

"Thanks, Robbie," Elysia said, standing up and stretching. Between the two of them, they managed to get the runestone, which was roughly the size of the Dursley's big-screen TV, settled into the pedestal. The trunk's interior, which had started as an empty 10ft^3^ room, shifted around them.

When everything stopped moving, they found themselves still in a 10ft^3^ room, but the ladder was gone and there was a door in its place. One of the walls was taken up with several displays, showing the status of the trunk's various wards, power levels, air and water, and so on. Through the door was a spacious living room, with a stairwell leading up out of the trunk and an open kitchen separated by a cooktop island. A short hallway led to two bedroom suites, a study with a workshop area, and a spacious training room. The entire place was brightly lit by both an ambient *lumos* and large bay windows throughout. It wasn't exactly a mansion, but for the two of them it was more than comfortable.

The living area was piled high with all of the spoils from the day's errands, but between the two of them they made short work of it all. In less than an hour, everything was squared away, and they fell into their beds exhausted but delighted. It was, Elysia thought to herself as she drifted off, going to be the best summer ever.

### #4 Privet Drive, Surrey	1994/06/27	6:30

The next morning, after the usual morning ablutions and a quick breakfast of porridge, fresh fruit, and a nutrient potion, Elysia sat in the training room to meditate. After the initial grounding, centering, and contemplation of emptiness, she decided to pop into her mindscape.

"Hello!" Janet greeted her, as soon as she opened her eyes. She'd appeared back in the study. "Great work yesterday! Good use of resources, too. The bond with Dobby -- well, Robbie now, which is a very good thing -- anyway, *that* was unexpected."

Elysia raised an eyebrow. "Oh? What do you mean?"

Janet assumed a preparing-to-give-a-lecture pose. "If you recall, there is a formal oath to bind a house elf. You can think of this an the Bond of Agency, for reference. It makes the elf an agent of the House, so that it may act in service to the House. It does not make the elf a *member* of the House. When you added in the line about being part of the family, the nature of the bond changed. Instead of a Bond of Agency, it became a Bond of Brotherhood. While you both now act in the interests of House Potter -- especially as the last two members of House Potter -- there is no subservience. This is a bond of equals. As far as Magic is concerned, you two are siblings now."

Elysia's eyes widened at that. "Woah! I have a brother!? This is so cool! I've always wanted a proper family..."

Janet smiled. "More than that, Ellie. The bond now acts more like a twin bond than a house-elf bond."

"Like the Weasley Twins?"

Janet nodded. "Just like that. A bit stronger, actually, thanks to how house-elf magic works. You can already share your subconscious knowledge library. You'll eventually be able to communicate telepathically, with enough practice, even without linking mindscapes."

"Wait, I can link mindscapes?"

Janet looked confused for a moment. "Oh, right, we weren't expecting this to come up yet. You weren't supposed to have to worry about symmetrical bonds like this until bonding with your soul-mates."

Elysia shook her head. "Wait, soul-*mates?* As in, more than one?"

"That's right," Janet replied. "You have two potential soul-mates that you are likely to meet in this phase of your life. It's not some mystical bond in and of itself; it just means that you're extremely compatible. You'll just *get* each other more easily. That said, that compatibility lends itself to certain kinds of magical bond-oaths. The most common is the magical Marriage Vows; most magical married couples can at least sense their partner's moods through this bond, although usually by the point that's even an option they've been able to read each other's body language well enough already."

"Okay, so are you saying that that's a lower end on the abilities of a bond like that?"

Janet smiled. "Exactly! Because of how in sync you are, there's less interference over the bond connection. That makes it more efficient, and so you can do more with that connection. Linking mindscapes is one of the more complex possibilities, as is sharing magic."

"Robbie did that with me yesterday."

"Yes, and that's a pretty common manifestation of a twin bond too. It all comes down to harmonics and thaumic resonance, really, for *any* bond. The more in-tune the ends are with each other, the better the connection."

"Okay, that's sounding like it's not limited to two people." Elysia said.

"It's not," Janet agreed. "There have been triad bonds, pack bonds, and House bonds before, for example. Obviously, the more people in the bond, the harder it is to get everyone in tune with each other, and therefore the less capable the bond becomes. Practically speaking, four is usually the upper limit for anything truly useful."

"That makes sense," Elysia said. "So, to compare this to light, or a radio, this is more about the frequency than the power?"

"You got it!" Janet exclaimed. "Power is more a function of your individual *internal* harmony. That's why magic is so heavily intent-based. The stronger your intent, the more *unified* you are in your intent, the more powerful your magic is. You should add the books about this to your list."

Elysia nodded. "I should just read them right now, honestly."

"I'll leave you to it, then," Janet replied, and vanished.

Elysia opened the binder on the desk.

> To Do
>
> - Find and read the primers on Bonds and Soul Magic
> - Establish a training regimen (see Appendix A)
> - Check out The Kiln at Red Wharf Bay

After Elysia finished off the primers, she cracked open Appendix A. She found a comprehensive training plan, covering calisthenics, free-weights, cardio, flexibility, martial arts forms, and magical development. There were specific exercises to build magical stamina (by casting and holding a wandless *Patronus* charm for longer and longer intervals), control (by wandlessly levitating more and more tennis balls while going through martial arts forms), power (the classic shooting gallery, with more and more durable targets), and finesse (more and more detailed *Image*-class illusion charms). Each day's workout ended with stretching and a meditation session. All told, she expected it to take anywhere from an hour to the entire day, depending on what point she was at in the training cycle and how much time she wanted to spend that day.

From yesterday's reading, she knew that, while she could use shifting to augment her physical abilities, only exercise would build the base level. The stronger she got *without* shifting, the more she'd be able to do *with.*
