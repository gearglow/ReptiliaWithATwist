# Reptilia With A Twist

## Summary

Harry is a trans girl, and ends up in the Afterlife (which looks suspiciously like The Good Place). The usual Reptilia28 challenge ensues, with a twist or two.

### Reptilia28 Challenge Details

> Harry is killed at 17 during the fight with Voldemort. He's sent to his Death's office (explained later) and finds out that this isn't the first time that this has happened.
>
> Harry's Death (who can have a human  name) is mad at his arrival. Apparently, people dying before their time is a black mark on the various Deaths' records, and Harry is getting  perilously close to getting this particular one fired.
>
> When Harry asks what was supposed to have happened, Death goes off on a rant saying how he was supposed to have killed Voldemort, found his soulmate ("Some Granger girl…") and lived to be a centennial age.  But since Harry keeps getting into life-threatening situations for one reason or another, he keeps dying before that happens. Harry is surprised about the soul mate part.
> Death gives Harry a paper to sign that allows him to retain his memories (the previous times, he wasn't given this option for some reason). Harry is deposited to a previous time of the writer's choosing.
> Eventually, Harry gets it right. He kills Voldemort, gets the girl, and lives to a ripe old age of whatever. And Death doesn't get fired.
>
> REQUIREMENTS:
> Harry must have died at least three times before this one. The memory keeping contract must  be included. Death must refer to Hermione as "some Granger girl" when Harry's soul mate turns up in his rant. Obviously, must at least be Harmony.
>
> OPTIONAL: Dumbledore's manipulations can be a factor in Harry's premature demises."

### Changes and Adjustments
> + Make A Wish: What if Harry really was just that good?
>+ Can't keep timeline memories, but can train up in the afterlife and keep that. 
>    + Training includes mind magics 
>+ Can make a plan with whichever advisors are desired. The plan lives in Harry's mindscape and can only be accessed during occlumentic meditation.
>+ Death (Eleanor?) grants a boon: limited precognition so Harry (almost) always sees a direct attack coming far enough in advance to counter it. This might just be on an instinctive level, or it might go so far as to be a full-blown vision, depending on the attack.
>+ No way is Eleanor getting fired, but she's a romantic at heart (and *really* wants to hook up with Destiny if she can help her latest pet project along).

## Chapter 1: Wait, what?

The first thing Harry saw was a white wall with green letters, which said, *Welcome! Everything is fine.*

*That's nice,* Harry thought. *I wonder where I am, though?* The room looked like a generic waiting room in a generic office, with a generic sofa facing the wall with its soothing message.

*For that matter,* Harry thought, *how did I get here? The last thing I remember was... Voldemort. And the Forbidden Forest, and a green light... He spouted some cliché monologue, too. What was it again? Oh, right. "Harry Potter, the Boy-Who-Lived. Come to die."* Something about that line made Harry very uncomfortable, but she couldn't quite... wait a minute. *She!?*

"... Oh." Harry looked down at herself, and realized that for the first time she felt comfortable in her own skin.

Of course, the fact that she was wearing clothes that actually *fit* for once didn't hurt either.

A door opened off to the left, and a voice startled her out of her reverie.

"Ms. Potter? We're ready for you."



+++++



"Harry? Hi, I'm Eleanor," the blonde behind the desk said. "Have a seat and we'll get started."

Harry sat. The chair was surprisingly comfy.

Eleanor opened a folder on the desk, which Harry didn't think was there a second ago.

"So. First things first. You, Harry James Potter, are dead."

Harry sat up with a start. "Wait, what?"

Eleanor stared across the desk with an amused quirk of the eyebrow. "Again. You've died kind of a lot, huh? Not that it's really your fault. Your enemies cheat like my ex. This time they even got you to walk right into a Killing Curse, voluntarily. Not your best moment, though you *did* score major points for selflessness. Or, you would have, if it had made any difference at all. Sorry, kid, your heroic sacrifice was for nothin'."

Harry's jaw dropped. "You mean Voldemort *won!?*" She buried her face in her hands and growl-screamed into them.

"'Fraid so, kiddo. But don't worry! You're in the Good Place now. Well, for the moment."

Harry looked up, hands still poised in case of further bouts of screaming. "For the moment? Wha-?"

Eleanor sighed, and slapped her hands on the desk. "Look, kid, I'm going to level with you. Most people, they kick the bucket, show up here or " -- she blew a raspberry and gave a thumbs-down -- "the Bad Place, work through a few Purgatory cycles, and move on. You're not most people. You got whammied by Destiny, so you get to go back and try again until you get whatever Destiny has in store for you out of the way." 

Harry put her face back in her hands and growl-screamed again.

Eleanor flipped through the folder. "Lessee here. Ooh, tough break, kid," she winced. "Destiny's kind of cruel sometimes. Don't tell her I said that, though; still trying to get her to hook up with me. She can *rock* that LBD, y'know what I'm sayin'?" She winked in exaggerated fashion.

Harry snorted into her hands and looked up with a surprised giggle.

"Anyway," Eleanor continued, "that Vole-dee-mort guy. Sounds like a rodent. Ya gotta *exterminate* him before you can get to the good stuff, which means *you* get to go back. Again. Geez, what is this, your twelfth time?"

Harry shrugged. "I don't remember."

"Oh, right, that whole wipe-your-memory-so-you-don't-break-spacetime thing." Eleanor groused. "Sorry about that. Not my call. I'm just filling in for Michael this go-round," she continued, *sotto voce.* "Poor guy gets a little stir-crazy every few Beremies."

Finally starting to relax, Harry settled back into her chair again. "So, um..." she started. "What's next? Actually, wait. First, why am I a girl? Or, why was I a guy? Or... whatever." She waved a hand vaguely. "Not that I'm complaining now, but what the *fork?*" Her eyes widened. "Fork? Why can't I say 'fork?'"

Eleanor grinned. "Yeah, that's from the first draft of the Good Place. We all thought it was funny, so it kind of just stuck around. And you've always been a girl, Harry. You just never got the chance to show it back on Earth. Blame Bumblesnore, or whatever his name is, for that. Devious little shirt was worse than that Vole guy, in some ways." She flipped through the folder again. "Wow, what a jerk! Talked you into eating that AK, left you to rot in Durzkaban, kept all *kinds* of secrets from you, potioned up you and your potential soul-mates to keep you apart -- especially that Granger girl." She looked up, eyes blazing. "Sean's going to have a *field day* with him."

"Hermione?" Harry blurted. "*She's* my soul-mate?"

"*Potential* soul-mate. You've run across a couple, looks like. It really just means that you're super-compatible and you *get* each other. Or *can,* eventually. Looks like that Lovegood girl's another one."

"*Luna!?*" Harry squeaked.

"Yup!" Eleanor chirped. "Ooh, and they're both potentials for each other, too. How's *that* for good luck?" She winked at Harry again, and waggled her eyebrows outrageously.

Harry blushed beet-red. "I... I... Um..."

"Woah, easy there, Beyoncé," Eleanor grinned.

Harry just looked confused.

"Beyoncé? Like, Destiny's Child? Because you're a Child of Destiny?"

Harry looked even more confused, somehow. Eleanor sighed. "Jeez, kid, get a radio."

Harry shook her head. Pulling herself together finally, she asked, "So, what, I need to go back, kill the Dark Plonker once and for all, get the girl -- girls? -- *be* a girl, and live to a ripe old age? How am I supposed to do that if I keep forgetting everything every time I go back?"

Eleanor thought for a minute, then grinned. "Janet!"



+++++



Janet, it turned out, was a hyper-evolved sentient interface to the sum total of all knowledge in the universe, and an absolute sweetheart too. Between the three of them, a plan was soon formed.

"Just sign here, here, and here," Janet said, handing Harry a contract. "This should keep the Judge happy. It says that, while you won't remember your last life, you can keep your training from here in the Good Place in your subconscious, and a plan of action in your occlumency mindscape. Basically, you'll get mind magic training first, and everything after that gets tucked away in the mindscape you'll build as part of that. You'll still have any instincts and muscle memory that result from any training you do here, and the actual knowledge will come to you if you focus on it. But you won't remember your time here, or anything like that. Just your training, and not as lived experience. It might feel weird at first when you go back."

Harry smiled nervously. "It's better than going back blind like before, I suppose."

"Right?" Eleanor said. "Well! That's settled. Let's get to it! Janet made a sweet little place for you to train, and... 'live,' I guess? I mean, you're dead, but..."

"The word you're looking for is 'reside,' Eleanor," Janet interjected with a smile.

"Thanks, babe," Eleanor said. "Anyway, she named it Elysium after some ancient Greek idea of a hero's afterlife. Seemed fitting."



+++++



## Chapter 2: Making Memories

"This. Is. Awesome!" Harry gushed, looking around her own personal Elysium. There was a cozy-looking cottage, some lightly-forested grounds at the edge of a crystal-clear lake, and a *quidditch pitch!* The lake had a small cabana on its beach, a fire pit next to some log benches, and a few large boulders perfect for sunning or diving. The grounds had a large grassy clearing, with a perfectly round border of white stone.

Janet had a smug smile, and Eleanor was grinning like a Cheshire cat. "Wait 'til you see the inside!"

They walked into the cottage and Harry *squealed.*

"Oh Merlin, it's *wonderful!*"

The door opened into a main room with a sunken den area, ringed with squashy sofas, facing a hearth with several hooks on swiveling arms mounted to one side. Through one doorway was a roomy, well-appointed kitchen with plenty of counter space, and through another was a well-lit library, with a large desk and several squashy armchairs. A door in the kitchen turned out to be a staircase down to a fully-appointed basement potions lab. Last there was a door across the den area which led to a large bedroom with a king-size four-poster, with French doors opening onto a deck facing the lake. Across from the French doors was a bathroom with a sunken jacuzzi tub. The whole place had a cozy, rustic aesthetic which Harry found thoroughly comforting.

"I should hope so," Janet said. "I got it from your past lives' daydreams about having a place of your own. With a few modifications for the training you'll be undertaking, of course."
