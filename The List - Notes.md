# The List - Notes

## Plot Points

- What to do about Draco? Now that Lucius is out of the picture, how does he change? And how does he react to Elysia as a girl?
- Neville x Ron - they balance each other out in temperament, and commiserate over their self-esteem issues.
- Parvati & Lavender teach Elysia about make-up and such. She runs with it to devastating effect. Tends to rock the tomboy look, but will sometimes femme it up to mess with people.
- Technology and magic don't mix? Only according to *Hogwarts: A History,* which is known to be fallible to begin with. There are plenty of examples *in canon* where they *do* mix -- cars and motorbikes, in particular. Hogwarts has archaic wards to protect from lightning strikes (which predate any kind of intentional use of electricity), and they interfere with electronics, and wizards, being fucking morons, didn't put two and two together. The wards also interfere with lightning spells.
- Elysia gets a computer (laptop - [ThinkPad 755CD](https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:755CD), palmtop - [Dauphin DTR-1](http://www.oldcomputers.net/dauphin-dtr-1.html), or desktop - (RISC PC?)) after gaining majority to help keep herself organized. Or maybe this one's better for Elysiad instead of this story.
- Blaise's Pocket Boggart (a la [All According to Plan](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001792/1/All-According-to-Plan)) but the boggart turns into Blaise pulling out a pocket boggart, which turns into Blaise... *ad nauseum.*
- Elysia pulls Snape into Elysium, where Lily tears him a new one and James apologizes. Snape becomes an ally, though he's still a prickly little bastard. Still, Elysia does need a magical adult on her team who *isn't* a Weasley or blindy following Dumbledore.
- > Lily is a little terrifying. As in, she's tiny and *eldritch.*  -- Cat

## Waveform Model of Magic

Magic operates similarly to, but distinct from, electromagnetic radiation.



## Bonds, Oaths, and Such

A link (ie. legilimency) is like a radio broadcast, and is therefore subject to external interference.

A bond is like a wired connection, and therefore external interference is less of a problem. The effectiveness of the bond is a direct function of harmonic resonance between the endpoints. If they're all in sync, things go smoothly. If not, they interfere with each other.

The oaths define the 'protocols,' ie. what and how gets send over the bond. Is this like making a phone call, or like dialing a modem? Could be either, depending on intent, but if the oath precludes one or the other, it won't go through.

Due to bleed-off and progressive resonance, the end-points of the bond slowly become more in sync with each other. This causes shifts in both what carries over the bond, and how it manifests. As this is initially determined by the terms of the oath, that means that bonds tend to amplify traits relevant to their terms.

The more people in the bond, the harder it is to get everyone in tune with each other, and therefore the less capable the bond becomes. Practically speaking, four is usually the upper limit for anything truly useful.

To compare this to light, or a radio, this is more about the frequency than the power.

Power is more a function of your individual *internal* harmony. That's why magic is so heavily intent-based. The stronger your intent, the more focused and *unified* you are in your intent, the more powerful your magic is.


## Politics

### Factions

#### The Light 

Dumbledore's faction. Traditionalist, authoritarian. Claim to be progressive, but are actually centrist. Paternalistic about the Statute, muggles, blood purity... everything, really. Pro-censorship. Pro-restriction on personal freedoms.


#### The Dark

The Death Eater faction. Traditionalist, authoritarian. Conservative extremists. Fascists, really. Against restrictions on personal freedoms and censorship, but only for purebloods. Didn't start out that way, but the polarizing effect of Voldemort's Blood War affected The Dark particularly strongly.


#### The Grey

Minority Progressives. Pragmatic. Pro-Reform (or revolution if the opportunity arises) about pretty much everything Traditionalist. Anti-Authoritarian, Anti-Statute, Anti-Blood-Puritan. Against restrictions on personal freedoms and censorship for everyone, not just purebloods.


#### Unaligned

What it says on the tin.
