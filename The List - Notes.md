# The List - Notes

## Plot Points

- [x] Elysia pulls Snape into Elysium, where Lily tears him a new one and James apologizes. Snape becomes an ally, though he's still a prickly little bastard. Still, Elysia does need a magical adult on her team who *isn't* a Weasley or blindly following Dumbledore.

- What to do about Draco? Now that Lucius is out of the picture, how does he change? And how does he react to Elysia as a girl? Draco realizes Lucius is out of the picture, and Narcissa walks away from her marriage once Sirius is exonerated, Draco starts thinking for themself. Goes by Dorea maybe?

- ~~Ginny x Draco/Dorea? Not immediately, of course, but as Draco realizes Lucius is out of the picture, and Narcissa walks away from her marriage once Sirius is exonerated, Draco starts thinking for themself. Ginny is still recovering from being possessed by the Diary, and the two find common ground in that process of rebuilding themselves.~~

- ~~Neville x Ron? - they balance each other out in temperament, and commiserate over their self-esteem issues.~~

- Draco x Ron - they really are rather similar in a lot of ways... 

- Ginny x Nell (transfem!Neville) - they balance each other really well, though if you set them both off at the same time _watch out._

- Parvati & Lavender teach Elysia about make-up and such. She runs with it to devastating effect. Tends to rock the tomboy look, but will sometimes femme it up to mess with people.

- Eleanor is all for vengeance, and is well-versed in the Trolley Problem, so Elysia has no compunctions about not being entirely Light. Or even going full-on Dark, really. Assassinations won't be *common,* but they might just happen anyway. Heists, on the other hand... *hell yes.*

- Elysia talks Madame Pomphrey into starting a therapy group, given all the insanity of the past few years (and now this one). She, Ginny, Draco, Luna, Hermione, and a few others join.

- How did Lily stop the AK? A conjured wall of bullet-proof plexiglass with protection wards. The AK can't pass through the solid object, but sets off a cascade failure which blows up the room. The plexiglass helps shield the baby, but the conjuration doesn't last long after Lily dies. The infamous scar is just from debris, but the open wound attracts Riddle's loose soul fragment.

- Unbreakable Vows and Oaths cannot be sworn under duress. They can only be sworn freely and in full knowledge.

- Technology and magic don't mix? Only according to *Hogwarts: A History,* which is known to be fallible to begin with. There are plenty of examples *in canon* where they *do* mix -- cars and motorbikes, in particular. Hogwarts has archaic wards to protect from lightning strikes (which predate any kind of intentional use of electricity), and they interfere with electronics, and wizards, being fucking morons, didn't put two and two together. The wards also interfere with lightning spells.

- Elysia gets a computer (laptop - [ThinkPad 755CD](https://www.thinkwiki.org/wiki/Category:755CD), palmtop - [Dauphin DTR-1](http://www.oldcomputers.net/dauphin-dtr-1.html), or desktop - (RISC PC?)) after gaining majority to help keep herself organized. Or maybe this one's better for Elysiad instead of this story.

- Blaise's Pocket Boggart (a la [All According to Plan](https://www.fanfiction.net/s/13001792/1/All-According-to-Plan)) but the boggart turns into Blaise pulling out a pocket boggart, which turns into Blaise... *ad nauseum.*

- > Lily is a little terrifying. As in, she's tiny and *eldritch.*  -- Cat

- "Look! Up in the sky!" Lee Jordan yelled. "It's a bird!" Shouted Parvati. "It's a plane!" Colin Creevey shouted. "It's Beauxbatons!" Nell cried. Elysia and Hermione looked at each other, hummed the first few bars of the _Superman_ theme, and cracked up.

- Dealing with Dragons: Hermione & Luna help Elysia carve out a full-sensory illusion runic schema, remote-triggered by an aetheric rune, which puts on a show and distracts the dragon. Meanwhile, Elysia uses {a tunneling spell | fumation | lightning leap | shadow striding } to circle under the arena, pop out next to the golden egg, snag it, and escape. She dispels the illusion at the exit, takes a bow, and saunters off.

- CAST: Computer-Aided Spellcrafting and Thaumaturgy. Useful for virtual prototyping of spells and schema. (This needs to be in Elysiad, too.)

- Personal ward amulet

- Heirship of any of the Four Founders falls to whoever performs the Heirship Ritual with a Founder's Relic. The ritual is lost to time, which means Elysia can cheat her way into knowing it - and for all four Founders, too.

- The Furies: Elysia's polycule and all-girl spec-ops team. They share power and abilities (like shifting) through a bond-oath. (Could be in Elysiad too, actually.)

- Punk rock influences: Siouxsie And The Banshees, Poison Girls, Bikini Kill, Wasted Youth, Chumbawumba (esp. _Anarchy_), The Clash

- Other musical influences: _War Pigs_ by Black Sabbath

- The Potters have Basque roots, such that a decent chunk of their grimoires are in Aquitanian and therefore completely unintelligible to most people. The family is also known historically for golems and related soul-magics.

- How to neutralize dementors: sink them. They cause everything around them to freeze, so they'll end up encasing themselves in ice.

## Elysia's Training Routine

> A comprehensive training plan, covering calisthenics, free-weights, cardio, flexibility, martial arts forms, combat shifting, and magical development. There were specific exercises to build magical stamina (by casting and holding a wandless *Patronus* charm (or several, at more advanced stages) for longer and longer intervals), control (by wandlessly levitating more and more tennis balls while going through martial arts forms), power (the classic shooting gallery, with more and more durable targets), and finesse (more and more detailed *Image*-class illusion charms). Each day's workout ended with stretching and a meditation session. All told, she expected it to take anywhere from an hour to the entire day, depending on what point she was at in the training cycle and how much time she wanted to spend that day.

> While she could use shifting to augment her physical abilities, only exercise would build the base level. The stronger she got *without* shifting, the more she'd be able to do *with.*


## Cool Magic Elysia Can Do

## Grimoire

- Horcruxes can be removed from whatever they possess via the spell _suntsitu arima lotua,_ which is Basque for "destroy the bound soul."
- The Dark Mark can be removed with the spell _lotu askatu,_ which is Basque for "free the bound."
- Runes can be cleanly removed from a surface with _kendu akatsa_ (Basque for "remove the blemish").
- Magical travel by lightning bolt can be done via the _tximista ibili_ technique (Basque for "ride the lightning").
- Move through the ground as if through water under the effects of gillyweed using the spell _zulo,_ which is Basque for "burrow."
- Unassisted flight with perfect maneuverability and immunity to inertia and wind resistance (speed and acceleration determined by intent when casting) is _hegan egin mugarik gabe_ (Basque for "fly without limits"). While this can be cast as a charm, there is also a ritual to grant this ability permanently, with all parameters able to be adjusted on-the-fly as desired.
- Take on a ghost-like, insubstantial form with _mamuzko forma_ (Basque for "ghostly form"). Removes the need to breathe, but the subject can no longer physically interact with the physical world aside from anything on their person when the spell was cast. Interaction via magic still works just fine.
- Hold and move something with the mind (classic telekinesis): _telekinetikoa_ ("telekinetic grasp" in Basque).
- Poltergeist form, which combines the last two: የፖሊተር ሐኪም ቅፅ (Amharic, pronounced "yepolīteri ḥākīmi k’it͟s’i").
- Conjures blades of pure arcane force which can be controlled with a thought: _indar-palak_ ("force blades" in Basque).
- Spot-shield against any directed spell, even the Unforgivables, with _svartholsskjöldur_ (Icelandic for "black-hole shield").
- Glowing-path-style locator spell: _monstrant viam._
- Magic walkie-talkies: хол ярих (_khol yarikh_, Mongolian for "far speak").
- Ball Lightning: 球電 (_kyuu-den_, Japanese) or _pilota tximista_ (Basque).
- Lightning bolt: _tximista_ (Basque) or _fulmen_ (Latin).
- Lightning blade: _fulmineum_ (Latin) or _tximista pala_ (Basque).
- Wide-area stunner: _stupefacio locus._

## Magic Technicalities

### Waveform Model of Magic

Magic operates similarly to, but distinct from, electromagnetic radiation.



### Bonds, Oaths, and Such

A link (ie. legilimency) is like a radio broadcast, and is therefore subject to external interference.

A bond is like a wired connection, and therefore external interference is less of a problem. The effectiveness of the bond is a direct function of harmonic resonance between the endpoints. If they're all in sync, things go smoothly. If not, they interfere with each other.

The oaths define the 'protocols,' ie. what and how gets send over the bond. Is this like making a phone call, or like dialing a modem? Could be either, depending on intent, but if the oath precludes one or the other, it won't go through.

Due to bleed-off and progressive resonance, the end-points of the bond slowly become more in sync with each other. This causes shifts in both what carries over the bond, and how it manifests. As this is initially determined by the terms of the oath, that means that bonds tend to amplify traits relevant to their terms.

The more people in the bond, the harder it is to get everyone in tune with each other, and therefore the less capable the bond becomes. Practically speaking, four is usually the upper limit for anything truly useful.

To compare this to light, or a radio, this is more about the frequency than the power.

Power is more a function of your individual *internal* harmony. That's why magic is so heavily intent-based. The stronger your intent, the more focused and *unified* you are in your intent, the more powerful your magic is.


## Politics

### Factions

#### The Light

Dumbledore's faction. Traditionalist, authoritarian. Claim to be progressive, but are actually centrist. Paternalistic about the Statute, muggles, blood purity... everything, really. Pro-censorship. Pro-restriction on personal freedoms.


#### The Dark

The Death Eater faction. Traditionalist, authoritarian. Conservative extremists. Fascists, really. Against restrictions on personal freedoms and censorship, but only for purebloods. Didn't start out that way, but the polarizing effect of Voldemort's Blood War affected The Dark particularly strongly.


#### The Grey

Minority Progressives. Pragmatic. Pro-Reform (or revolution if the opportunity arises) about pretty much everything Traditionalist. Anti-Authoritarian, Anti-Statute, Anti-Blood-Puritan. Against restrictions on personal freedoms and censorship for everyone, not just purebloods. Not anti-Tradition *per se,* but pro-reform for a less toxic society. Ancoms, really, in the more extreme members. This is the leftist party. Does not yet exist until Elysia and co. start making waves.


#### Unaligned

What it says on the tin.
