# The List - Outtakes

## Vanquishing Viktor

Elysia, Luna, and Hermione were studying in the library one day when Viktor Krum walked up to them.

"Herm-own-ninny? May I haff a word?"

Hermione nodded. "Sure, what's up?"

"Alone?"

Hermione's eyes narrowed. "No."

"Fine. You will go to ball with me, yes?"

"No. What, are you potioned or something? I'm already going with Ellie and Luna."

Krum looked askance. "But they are girls!"

Hermione shrugged. "We're lesbians."

"What is--"

Hermione switched to Bulgarian. "I _said,_ we're lesbians, you idiot!"

Krum scoffed. "Bah! You just haven't met the right man yet. Come with me, I show you how a _real_ man treats a lady."

All three girls stood at that, and unleashed a tightly-focused aura of pure, unadulterated, pants-shitting terror upon him.

"Run, little boy," Hermione growled, "before you have to be carried out in a pine box."

Krum _whimpered,_ a low, primal sound like that of a cornered prey animal, before turning tail and fleeing like the hounds of hell were after him.

"Ellie," Hermione bit out, "if you don't utterly _destroy_ that arrogant, misogynistic, Neanderthal-brained _worm_ in the duel, I'll do it myself."

"I'll help," Luna added.

"No worries there," Elysia said. "He'll be lucky if I don't outright kill him for that. I wonder... is there a tongue-tearing curse?"

"I'll craft it myself if there's not," Luna said. "Nobody messes with _our_ 'Mione."



## Going Grey

"Fuck it," Hermione spat. "Playing by the rules has gotten us _nowhere._"

"So, what, you want to burn it all down and start over?" Ginny asked, playing with some wandless bluebell flames. The flickering blue light cast unsettling shadows across the Pack's 'den,' the newly-added rune-augmented basement of the cottage at The Kiln.

"Got a better idea?"

"Mask up first?"

"Hmm. We _are_ all shapeshifters," Elysia mused. "And nobody can ward against us..."

"Alright," Luna said. "So we go full-on vigilante. But how far do we go? And what happens after?"

"As far as it takes," Nell said, eyes blazing.

"Could you really kill someone in cold blood, Longbottom?" Dorea said. "Not sure I could."

"Some people, maybe," Nell retorted. "The Lestranges? Umbitch? Abso-fucking-lutely."

"You can't know that, Nell," Elysia said, staring blankly into the distance. "Not without actually taking a life. After I killed Quirrelmort back in first year, it took _ages_ to come to terms with it. It _still_ haunts me, honestly. And that was most certainly not in cold blood. Hell, it wasn't even intentional." She heaved a shuddering sigh. "I'm not saying no assassinations. Morgana knows you don't win a war without getting your hands bloody. But don't make light of it. There's a reason cold-blooded murder is part of making a horcrux."

"So petrify them," Luna said. "Or frame them. And nobody's said what happens after. What are we fighting for? What's worth getting our hands bloody?"



## Tombstone Throw-Down

When the portkey set her down, it was definitely _not_ anywhere near Hogwarts.

Elysia saw headstones, and immediately dropped to the ground, quickly shifting her tracking amulet beneath her skin.

_I'm in the Riddle graveyard,_ she sent. _No contact yet. How's the pensieve feed?_

_Roger that,_ Robbie replied. _Relaying and holding position. Feed is still live._

Rising to a crouch, Elysia took a longer look at her surroundings. There at the top of a hill was Riddle Manor, looking like nothing so much as a stereotypical haunted house. Closer to her position, headstones rose like teeth, and she was struck by how badly such a mouth would cause Hermione's parents to despair. Here and there were larger monuments, and the occasional tree. Overall, Elysia was reminded of that _Addams Family_ movie they'd watched last fall just before the tournament. _Hopefully no disembodied hands, though,_ she mused.

Rising from her crouch, she moved slowly further into the cemetery, playing the role of 'scared kid out of her depth' as well as she could. 

"_Stupefy!_"

She threw herself forward in a roll, timing it so that the spell just barely missed. She popped to her feet right in front of Peter Pettigrew, who dropped the bundle of rags he'd been holding as he fumbled his wand.

"Pettigrew!" She growled, as he backed away.

"Potter," he greeted, raising his wand again. "This will go much easier if you just _hold still._" He shot a _petrificus totalis_ at her, and she let it hit.

"_Wormtail,_" a high, sibilant voice came from the bundle of rags. It sounded highly affronted, to Elysia's ears. "You _dropped_ me!"

It was a very good thing she was immobile, because there was _no_ way she'd be able to hold in her laughter otherwise, and that would give the game away for sure.



+++++



Eventually Pettigrew got her tied to a grave marker -- some sort of angel statue, rather than a normal headstone, with the name _Tom Riddle_ on it -- and had a bathtub-sized cauldron bubbling away.

"Faster, Wormtail," Voldemort commanded, for it had been the Dork Lard himself who Pettigrew had dropped -- embodied in a scaly red baby's body, but Voldemort nevertheless.

"Yes, my lord," Pettigrew replied, flinching.

_So far so good,_ Elysia sent. _Wormtail's starting the ritual now. The snake's here._

_Copy that,_ Robbie replied.

The snake, as mentioned, had taken up station circling the ritual area where the cauldron and grave marker were. Elysia could feel the malevolent aura of the last horcrux.

"Bone of the father..." Pettigrew intoned, beginning the ritual. 

Elysia had to stifle a laugh; only Pettigrew's hand was what they thought it was. The remains of every last body in the graveyard had been surreptitiously replaced with transfigured pig bones months ago, when they'd taken the Ring from the Gaunt shack. And the blood Pettigrew had 'forcibly taken' from Elysia was actually from a muggle blood bank -- she'd shifted reservoirs into place under her skin to hold it, and shifted it all to where Pettigrew's knife 'cut' her when the time came.

Finally, Pettigrew dropped Babymort in the cauldron. Nothing happened for a moment -- and then, with a great gout of blinding (and oddly liquid) light, a human figure stood.

It bore a striking resemblance to Vernon Dursley.

_Huh. Must've been the pig bones,_ Elysia mused. _I wonder if he has a tail like Dudley's?_

While Voldemort's new body was rather broad, there the resemblance ended, for not even in Elysia's nightmares did Vernon Dursley ever have scales for skin, nor slitted red eyes. Still, he _did_ bring to mind a ball python which had just finished off a juicy rat, complete with what could only be called a snoot.

"Robe me, Wormtail!" He commanded. 

Wormtail hurried to comply, and also handed over a bone-white wand.

"_Crucio,_" Voldemort cast casually, dispassionate as Pettigrew writhed and screamed under the curse. "You are a pathetic excuse for a wizard, aren't you, Wormtail?" He added, halting the spell.

"Yes, my lord," Pettigrew gasped, clutching the still-bleeding stump of his right hand.

"Though I suppose this body is serviceable, and I have you to thank for it," Voldemort continued. "Give me your arm, Wormtail."

"Oh _thank you,_ master!" Pettigrew gushed, holding out his bloody stump.

"Your _other_ arm, Wormtail," Voldemort corrected, eyes flashing with contempt.

"Y-yes, my lord."

Voldemort pressed his wand viciously into Pettigrew's now-bared Dark Mark. "And now, we shall _see_," he hissed, "who has remained loyal, and who yet doubts."

_Ugh, such a drama queen,_ Elysia sent. _Is everyone seeing this?_

Robbie snorted. _Yeah, they're seeing it. Russ is delivering some absolutely_ scathing _commentary._

A cloud of death eaters apparated in, forming a circle around them.

_And here come the clowns,_ Elysia added.

Voldemort began monologuing as Elysia and Robbie kept up a running commentary. 

_Ooh, how shiny! I've got to hand it to him!_ Elysia sent as Voldemort spelled a silver appendage over Pettigrew's stump.

_I guess Pettigrew's not so 'armless after all,_ Robbie added.

_Bro. If I weren't tied up right now I'd be face-palming._

_And now Peter can too!_

_Ugh, why?_ Elysia sent, stifling her giggles.

"And now we come to our guest of honor," Voldemort proclaimed, gesturing at Elysia. "The so-called Boy-Who-Lived."

"Misgendering me? Really? What are you, a muggle?" Elysia said, rolling her eyes. "You and Dumbledore both, I swear."

"_Crucio!_" Voldemort raged.

Elysia let the curse hit, routing the pain signals to a specially-constructed area of her mind and showing no reaction. _Huh. Not nearly as painful as I expected. Stubbing a toe hurts worse. The muggle blood paid off, I guess._

"Is that all you've got, Tommy? My house-elf hits harder than that!"

Confused muttering began circulating among the death eaters.

"_Silencio!_ As I was saying, Harry Potter -"

"_Elysia_ Potter, thank you, Mister Riddle, you half-blood bastard son of a muggle."

More confused muttering swept around the death eaters.

"Silence, child! You are nothing! How could a mere infant vanquish I, Lord Voldemort, who has walked the road to immortality further than anyone! I, who has transcended the limits of humanity!"

"Not to mention my patience," Elysia said, having wandlessly dispelled her bonds, cast her favorite perfect reflexes spell, activated the dormant lockdown wards they'd placed when they'd dealt with the bones, and summoned her wand. "_You there, giant snake,_" she added in parseltongue, "_why do you put up with this windbag?_"

"_Nagini, attack the brat!_" Voldemort hissed.

"Your funeral," Elysia shrugged. "And here I thought you wanted to duel." _Lockdown is in effect._

_Copy that. Verifying phoenix fire gap. Verified._

_Commencing Operation Beatdown._

Elysia cast a sonic illusion, starting MC Hammer's "Can't Touch This" blasting throughout the graveyard. She then flicked a quick _suntsitu arima lotua_ at Nagini before anyone could react, sending the last horcrux to a screaming death.

"No!" Voldemort cried in alarm. "_Avada kedavra!_"

Elysia slipped a step sideways, easily dodging the curse. It flew past and struck one of the death eaters. She retaliated with a barrage of stinging jinxes, dancing among the death eaters as they retaliated with a hail of curses.

The death eaters grew steadily more enraged as every single curse missed, striking only other death eaters. Voldemort threw AKs and dark curses like confetti, while Elysia used only stinging jinxes and a Variable Deflector shield.

"Can't touch this!" She cackled, moonwalking between a piercing hex and an entrail-expelling curse as she disrupted an unmasked Bellatrix Lestrange mid-Crucio with another stinger.

Finally, only Bellatrix, Lucius (whose mask had been shattered), and Voldemort himself were left standing among a sea of bodies. Some were groaning, some gasping, some deathly silent. Elysia grinned as the music changed to Ini Kamoze's "Here Comes the Hotstepper."

"Good warm-up. I _almost_ broke a sweat!"

"Widdle baby Potter wants to play, huh?" Bellatrix taunted.

"Aww, does widdle baby Bella think she can handle it?" Elysia taunted back, swirling her wand around her. "_Fulmen!_" Lightning surged out from her, crackling as it struck her foes. She used it as cover to cast _zulo_ and sink into the ground. She then cast Hermione's favorite poltergeist variant Ghostform spell, the Amharic የፖሊተር ሐኪም ቅፅ (_yepolīteri ḥākīmi k’it͟s’i_).

"Where are you, you aggravating little brat?" Voldemort snarled, shaking off the effects of a multi-gigawatt jolt faster than his minions.

Elysia giggled. "What say we even the playing field a bit? सबै इन्द्रिय चाल (_sabai indriya cāla_)!"

Her Nepali Solid Illusion spell coalesced into the spectres of James and Lily Potter, wands drawn. As she cackled at the looks upon the faces of her foes, color flowed into James and Lily and they grew solid. She shunted control of the illusions to the mental constructs of her parents, leaving Janet in charge of the music.

"_Now_ it's a party!" James said. "_Gladius magnus!_" A glowing blade of pure magic grew from the tip of his wand.

"_Plokámia!_" Lily cast, conjuring eldritch tentacles of solid darkness, brimming with stray eyes, teeth, and worse. "So it is. And we're the life of the party!"

"_What._" Voldemort said, eyes bulging. "No magic can resurrect the dead!"

"Guess you weren't as far down that road to immortality as you thought," Elysia said, rising from the ground and dispelling her ghost form. "Now come on, snake, let's rumble!"

"What are you, a greaser?" Lily called out, flicking tentacles at Lucius with a manic grin.

"Why, I'm greased lightnin'!" Elysia called back. "_Fulmen ignem!_" A bolt of crackling flames lanced towards Voldemort, who tried to flick it away disdainfully but winced as his hand spasmed around his wand, which had caught fire.

"I must say, Tommikins, you've been quite the letdown so far," Elysia taunted. "I expected a _fight,_ not schoolyard games."

"_Avada kedavra!_" Voldemort bellowed in reply.

"_Svartholsskjöldur,_" Elysia flicked her wand disdainfully. A tiny black hole flickered into being, intercepting the curse before flickering back out with a pop and a flash of Hawking radiation. "How lazy. You are a pathetic excuse for a wizard, aren't you?" She threw his words to Pettigrew back at him with a smirk.

Voldemort's eyes narrowed and his wand became a flurry as he threw spell after spell at her. The air grew hot with residual magic as she countered everything he cast.

"Finally! A challenge! Oh, and by the way," Elysia said, still counter-casting silently. "My parents over there? Illusions." She disappeared in a gout of phoenix fire, simultaneously dispelling her illusory parents. Voldemort's wave of spells washed over Bellatrix and Lucius, and they fell with cries of anguish.

Another gout of phoenix fire bloomed at Voldemort's back as Elysia reappeared, eyes shifted to those of a basilisk. "Heya, Tom!"

Voldemort spun in shock, eyes meeting hers, and as the life was snuffed from him she darted forward with a vicious head-butt. As the lifeless corpse fell, she shifted her eyes back and her tracking amulet back out.

_Clear,_ she sent. _You can let the old meddler in now._
