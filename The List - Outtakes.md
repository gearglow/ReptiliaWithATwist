# The List - Outtakes



## Nell

"Alright, Nev?" Elysia asked, as a bemused Neville entered the common room one morning.

"Hey, Ellie," he said, ambling over. "I suppose so, only..." He flopped down on the sofa with a huff. "The headmaster just called me into his office, out of nowhere, for a casual chat. I'm not sure what to make of it."

Elysia furrowed her brow. "That _is_ odd."

Janet's voice popped into her mind suddenly. "Oh that scheming little-! He's hedging his bets because now the prophecy might not apply to you anymore because of the pronouns," she told Elysia. "The prophecy, I might remind you, which one Sybil Trelawney _made up_ in order to try to impress Dumbledore enough to be hired as Divination professor." She relayed the words of the so-called prophecy to Elysia, who looked at Neville with a calculating gaze before casting a dizzying array of subtle privacy palings.

She then proceeded to explain about the so-called prophecy, how it could have applied to either of them at the time, how it had affected her life, and finally, that Dumbledore was most likely trying to manipulate Neville into being a 'replacement Harry' because the prophecy's pronouns no longer fit.

Neville snorted, surprising Elysia. "Joke's doubly on him, then. Serves the scheming old goat right. Y'see, I'm not a bloke either."

"Wait, _what?_ You - huh. Yeah, that actually makes a lot of things make sense." Elysia mused.

"Right?" Neville said. "I tried telling Gran once, _ages_ ago, but she keeps trying to mold me into some sort of replacement for my father. You'd think that his wand not working for me would've clued her in, but no." She sighed. "I envy you, getting to transition already. Gran would _never_ give permission for the ritual, so I'm stuck waiting until I come of age. I can't wait until I can finally be Nell and don't have to be Neville anymore."

Elysia tapped her chin in thought. "Hmm. Y'know, I _might_ be able to help you out... You'll need to learn some mind magic first, though."

"What, like occlumency?" Nell said. "What's that got to do with it?"

"Because mind magic means getting to cheat at life," Elysia grinned a Marauder grin. "And I'm going to help you cheat like mad."



## Going Grey

"Fuck it," Hermione spat. "Playing by the rules has gotten us _nowhere._"

"So, what, you want to burn it all down and start over?" Ginny asked, playing with some wandless bluebell flames. The flickering blue light cast unsettling shadows across the Pack's 'den,' the newly-added rune-augmented basement of the cottage at The Kiln.

"Got a better idea?"

"Mask up first?"

"Hmm. We _are_ all shapeshifters," Elysia mused. "And nobody can ward against us..."

"Alright," Luna said. "So we go full-on vigilante. But how far do we go? And what happens after?"

"As far as it takes," Nell said, eyes blazing.

"Could you really kill someone in cold blood, Longbottom?" Dorea said. "Not sure I could."

"Some people, maybe," Nell retorted. "The Lestranges? Umbitch? Abso-fucking-lutely."

"You can't know that, Nell," Elysia said, staring blankly into the distance. "Not without actually taking a life. After I killed Quirrelmort back in first year, it took _ages_ to come to terms with it. It _still_ haunts me, honestly. And that was most certainly not in cold blood. Hell, it wasn't even intentional." She heaved a shuddering sigh. "I'm not saying no assassinations. Morgana knows you don't win a war without getting your hands bloody. But don't make light of it. There's a reason cold-blooded murder is part of making a horcrux."

"So petrify them," Luna said. "Or frame them. And nobody's said what happens after. What are we fighting for? What's worth getting our hands bloody?"
