# The List - Outtakes

## Dealing With Dragons

"Next up, our youngest competitor, Elysia Potter!" Bagman announced.

Robby pressed Play and hit the boom-box with a _sonorous._ The opening strains of AC/DS's _Thunderstruck_ began to ring out across the stadium.

_Go time,_ Elysia thought, entering the arena in time with the beat. The muggle-raised attendees were on their feet, stamping and shouting along, to the bemusement of the others (not to mention the enormous, horn-covered dragon across the arena).

"You've been --" Brian Johnson's screech echoed across the stadium, and Elysia raised her wand, muttering "_tximista ibili_" (which translated to "ride the lightning" in Basque, but she wasn't as much of a Metallica fan).

The kick-drums hit, and with it an echoing double-boom of thunder as she leapt to the golden egg in a bolt of lightning, scooped it up, and then rode another bolt to the arena's exit.

"Thunderstruck!" The crowd yelled.

Elysia bowed with a flourish and raised the egg high above her head. The crowd roared, the music faded out, and she sauntered off to be swept into a bone-crushing double-hug from her girlfriends.

## Going Grey

"Fuck it," Hermione spat. "Playing by the rules has gotten us _nowhere._"

"So, what, you want to burn it all down and start over?" Ginny asked, playing with some wandless bluebell flames. The flickering blue light cast unsettling shadows across the Pack's 'den,' the newly-added rune-augmented basement of the cottage at The Kiln.

"Got a better idea?"

"Mask up first?"

"Hmm. We _are_ all shapeshifters," Elysia mused. "And nobody can ward against us..."

"Alright," Luna said. "So we go full-on vigilante. But how far do we go? And what happens after?"

"As far as it takes," Nell said, eyes blazing.

"Could you really kill someone in cold blood, Longbottom?" Dorea said. "Not sure I could."

"Some people, maybe," Nell retorted. "The Lestranges? Umbitch? Abso-fucking-lutely."

"You can't know that, Nell," Elysia said, staring blankly into the distance. "Not without actually taking a life. After I killed Quirrelmort back in first year, it took _ages_ to come to terms with it. It _still_ haunts me, honestly. And that was most certainly not in cold blood. Hell, it wasn't even intentional." She heaved a shuddering sigh. "I'm not saying no assassinations. Morgana knows you don't win a war without getting your hands bloody. But don't make light of it. There's a reason cold-blooded murder is part of making a horcrux."

"So petrify them," Luna said. "Or frame them. And nobody's said what happens after. What are we fighting for? What's worth getting our hands bloody?"
