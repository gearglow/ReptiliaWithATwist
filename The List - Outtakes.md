# The List - Outtakes

## Hogwarts Express	1994/08/31

A ride on the Hogwarts Express wasn't complete without Draco Malfoy stopping by to make a nuisance of himself.

"Potter!" He blustered, banging open the door to their compartment. "Um..."

Elysia stood, and prowled to the door. Draco gulped.

"Hello, *Draco,*" She growled. She ran a finger across his jaw, channeling a Jelly-Legs Jinx. He flushed as his knees gave out and he tumbled out into the hallway. Elysia smirked, slammed the door shut, and locked it with several locking charms.

As she retook her seat, the compartment exploded in laughter.
