# The List - Outtakes



## Going Grey

"Fuck it," Hermione spat. "Playing by the rules has gotten us _nowhere._"

"So, what, you want to burn it all down and start over?" Ginny asked, playing with some wandless bluebell flames. The flickering blue light cast unsettling shadows across the Pack's 'den,' the newly-added rune-augmented basement of the cottage at The Kiln.

"Got a better idea?"

"Mask up first?"

"Hmm. We _are_ all shapeshifters," Elysia mused. "And nobody can ward against us..."

"Alright," Luna said. "So we go full-on vigilante. But how far do we go? And what happens after?"

"As far as it takes," Nell said, eyes blazing.

"Could you really kill someone in cold blood, Longbottom?" Dorea said. "Not sure I could."

"Some people, maybe," Nell retorted. "The Lestranges? Umbitch? Abso-fucking-lutely."

"You can't know that, Nell," Elysia said, staring blankly into the distance. "Not without actually taking a life. After I killed Quirrelmort back in first year, it took _ages_ to come to terms with it. It _still_ haunts me, honestly. And that was most certainly not in cold blood. Hell, it wasn't even intentional." She heaved a shuddering sigh. "I'm not saying no assassinations. Morgana knows you don't win a war without getting your hands bloody. But don't make light of it. There's a reason cold-blooded murder is part of making a horcrux."

"So petrify them," Luna said. "Or frame them. And nobody's said what happens after. What are we fighting for? What's worth getting our hands bloody?"
